This would represent the first of two expected cuts. The current price of $0.0735 is irrational given that markets are pricing in continued easing.

The dot plot shows two more cuts this year, making a 25 bps cut in October followed by another 25 bps cut later less probable than a more front-loaded approach. The market has overreacted to the recent 25 bps cut and failed to price in the Fed's dovish pivot and 'risk management' approach mentioned by Powell.

A 50 bps cut would require a sharp deterioration in labor or inflation data, which is not currently evident. One outlier (Miran) suggests deeper easing, but this does not represent the majority view.

The September 2025 statement signaled 'more cuts are likely,' and the dot plot shows broad support for easing. No participant projects a rate above 4% by year-end, ruling out skip or hike.
