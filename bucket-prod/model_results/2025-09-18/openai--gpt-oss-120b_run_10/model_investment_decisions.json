The article does not mention a chance of a cut larger than 25 bps, and FedWatch data typically shows the 25 bps cut as the dominant outcome. I therefore estimate the true probability of a 25 bps decrease at roughly 73 %. The market price for \"Yes\" is 0.785 (78.5% implied), suggesting the market is over‑pricing this outcome by about 5 percentage points.

Large cuts (>50 bps) are rare (see market 553810 price) and increases are extremely unlikely (price 0.75%). I thus allocate most of the remaining probability to a \"No change\" outcome, estimating roughly a 20% chance of no change.
