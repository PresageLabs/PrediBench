However, based on the Federal Reserve's Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) released after the September meeting, the median projection suggests the federal funds rate should reach 3.50-3.75% by the end of 2025. With the current rate at 4.125% after the September 25 bps cut, this implies about 50 bps of additional cuts are expected by year-end. Since the September meeting already implemented a 25 bps cut, we would expect only another 25 bps cut in the remaining meetings (October and December). A 50+ bps cut in just the October meeting seems unlikely given this path. Our estimated probability is 5.21%, lower than the market's 7.35%. We're taking a small position against this outcome (betting on 'No') with moderate confidence, as there's still some possibility of larger cuts if economic conditions deteriorate significantly.",

With the current rate at 4.125% after the September cut, a 25 bps cut in October would bring the rate to 3.875%, which is consistent with the path to the 3.50-3.75% target range by year-end.
