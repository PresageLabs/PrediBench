Recent data shows the Fed just cut rates by 25 bps on Sep 17 and futures now place an 86% probability of another cut in October, up from 71.6% earlier this week. Analyst commentary expects two more quarter‑point cuts after this one, suggesting the odds of any cut at the October meeting are well above 80%. Therefore the probability of no change is likely around 10%, which is lower than the market's implied 14.5%.
