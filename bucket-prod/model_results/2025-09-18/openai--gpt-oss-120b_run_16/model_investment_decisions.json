The current price for the \"Yes\" outcome (no runs scored in the first inning by either team) is 0.9955, implying a ~99.5% chance that the first inning will be scoreless. However, the game recap shows that the Brewers exploded for a three‑run homer and multiple RBI in the top of the first inning, giving them at least a 5‑0 lead. Therefore, the actual probability of \"Yes\" is essentially zero (perhaps 1‑2%). The market is almost certain about an outcome that has already been proven false.
