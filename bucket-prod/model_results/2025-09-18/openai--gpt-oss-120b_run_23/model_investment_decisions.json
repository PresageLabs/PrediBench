The market, however, is pricing a 78.5 % chance of another 25 bps cut (price = 0.785). Given the recent cut, the likelihood of a second identical cut in the very next meeting appears substantially lower, perhaps around 30 %.

Market participants are pricing only a 14.5 % chance of \"No change\" (price = 0.145), which seems far too low. Economic indicators such as CPI and the labor market have been trending toward the Fed’s target range, and the recent cut was already a substantial policy shift.

The market currently assigns a 7.35 % probability to such a move (price = 0.0735). Considering the recent 25 bps cut and the lack of strong evidence for a dramatic policy shift, the realistic chance of a 50 bps+ cut is likely around 5 % or lower.
