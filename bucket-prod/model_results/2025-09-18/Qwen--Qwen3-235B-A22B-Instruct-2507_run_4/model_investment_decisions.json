The Summary of Economic Projections suggests two more cuts in 2025, implying October is likely the next. The Fed's statement emphasizes 'additional adjustments' will depend on incoming data, but with inflation described as 'somewhat elevated' and employment risks rising, a 25 bps cut is the most balanced policy move.
