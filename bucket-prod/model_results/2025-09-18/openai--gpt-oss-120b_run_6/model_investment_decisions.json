Box scores and recaps from reputable sources (ESPN, CBS Sports, MLB.com) show that the Brewers scored a run in the first inning (Yelich doubled, Chourio scored). Therefore the correct outcome is \"No\". The market is dramatically overvaluing the \"Yes\" side, offering a near‑certain payoff for a near‑certain loss. This mispricing provides a high‑expected‑value opportunity to short the \"Yes\" outcome (i.e., bet on \"No\"). Given the certainty of the result, I assign a true probability of 0.01 for \"Yes\" (effectively 0%) and a confidence of 9/10.",
