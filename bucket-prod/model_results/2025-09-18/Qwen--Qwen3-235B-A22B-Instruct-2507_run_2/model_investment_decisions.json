            "rationale": "The market for 'Yes' (NRFI) is priced at 0.9955, implying a 99.55% chance of no runs in the 1st inning. However, tweets and game logs confirm Sal Frelick hit a 3-run homer in the 2nd, but also that the Brewers scored 5 runs by the end of the 2nd. More importantly, the game recap states: 'Sal Frelick. 3-run dinger! 5-0 #Brewers in the 2nd' — which means runs were scored in the 1st or 2nd. The play-by-play shows scoring in the 2nd, but the score was 5-0 by the 2nd, so at least one run must have scored in the 1st. Thus, 'Yes' is false. The price of 0.9955 for 'Yes' is profoundly mispriced. I bet the full $1.00 magnitude, but since other markets are also strong, I cap this at $0.10 and short this market by betting against 'Yes' (i.e., for 'No').",
