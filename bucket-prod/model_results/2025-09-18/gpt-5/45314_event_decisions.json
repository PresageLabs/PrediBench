        "rationale": "The game has concluded with a final score of Brewers 9, Angels 2, per MLB.com Gameday and ESPN box score/recap. The combined runs = 11, which is strictly greater than 7.5, so the correct resolution is Over. The market still shows Over at 0.82 as of 2025-09-18, implying settlement risk or stale pricing, creating clear positive EV. Given official MLB data confirms the outcome, I estimate the true probability at ~100%. Skipping other markets as allocating all capital to the highest EV (Over at ~18% edge) dominates alternatives (Brewers -1.5 at ~15% edge; NRFI Yes at ~0.45% edge; ML Brewers at ~3.55% edge).",
