Market participants have priced the probability of a further 25‑bps cut at 78.5% (price 0.785). Given the recent cut, the Fed is now more cautious about over‑tightening, and with inflation still above target, many economists see a high but not near‑certain chance of another 25‑bps cut – more like 60‑70% based on historical post‑cut behavior and the Fed's own projection of two additional cuts this year. Consequently the market appears to overprice the event. I will short the \"Yes\" outcome (i.e., bet against a 25‑bps cut) to capture this mispricing.",

An increase of 25+ bps in the October meeting would run counter to the stated policy stance and recent comments. The market odds for an increase are extremely low at 0.75% (price 0.0075). Even though the probability is tiny, there is a non‑zero chance of a surprise hike due to political pressure or unexpected data spikes, which may not be fully reflected.
