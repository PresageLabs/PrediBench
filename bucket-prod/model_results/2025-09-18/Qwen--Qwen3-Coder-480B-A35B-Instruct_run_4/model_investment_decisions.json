The Fed just cut rates by 25 bps in September 2025 and signaled two more cuts by year-end. With inflation still elevated and labor market showing signs of weakness, there's a significant possibility of an aggressive 50+ bps cut in October to prevent economic downturn. The recent 25 bps cut was already a response to worsening conditions, and if these conditions deteriorate further, a larger cut would be warranted.

If we exclude the 50+ bps scenario, the probability of a 25 bps cut would be around 58.5% (0.785 * (1 - 0.25)).
