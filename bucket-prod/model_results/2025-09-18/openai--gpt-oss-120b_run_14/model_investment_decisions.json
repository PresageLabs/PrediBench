This aligns with the Fed’s own statement that \"more cuts would follow\". The market’s current price for a 25‑bps cut (0.785) understates that probability – we estimate roughly a 90 % chance the Fed will cut by another 25 bps in October.

Based on the Fed’s forward guidance and the >90 % futures‑derived odds of a cut, we estimate the true probability of no change at about 5 %.

We think the chance is slightly higher, perhaps around 10 %, because the Fed could opt for a larger cumulative reduction if data deteriorates sharply.
