Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>",

              "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Performs Google web search and returns top results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The search query to perform.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_webpage: Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Use this tool to validate and return the final event decisions for all relevant markets.\nProvide decisions for all markets you want to bet on.\n    Takes inputs: {'market_decisions': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object'}, 'description': \"List of market decisions. Each dict should contain: 1. market_id (str): The market ID 2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't. 3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate) 4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high). 5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\"}, 'unallocated_capital': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'Fraction of capital not allocated to any bet (0.0 to 1.0)'}}\n    Returns an output of type: array\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"

If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.</market_description>\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0685\n2025-08-31    0.0645\n2025-09-01    0.0650\n2025-09-02    0.0670\n2025-09-03    0.0665\n2025-09-04    0.0720\n2025-09-05    0.0660\n2025-09-06    0.0605\n2025-09-07    0.0520\n2025-09-08    0.0520\n2025-09-09    0.0655\n2025-09-10    0.0840\n2025-09-11    0.1165\n2025-09-12    0.1215\n2025-09-13    0.0870\n2025-09-14    0.1010\n2025-09-15    0.0960\n2025-09-16    0.1070\n2025-09-17    0.1105\n2025-09-18    0.0735\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0735\n</market_553810>\n\n<market_553811>\nMarket ID: 553811\nQuestion: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.470\n2025-08-31    0.470\n2025-09-01    0.475\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.480\n2025-09-04    0.480\n2025-09-05    0.585\n2025-09-06    0.510\n2025-09-07    0.530\n2025-09-08    0.545\n2025-09-09    0.540\n2025-09-10    0.610\n2025-09-11    0.600\n2025-09-12    0.605\n2025-09-13    0.625\n2025-09-14    0.675\n2025-09-15    0.685\n2025-09-16    0.695\n2025-09-17    0.685\n2025-09-18    0.785\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.785\n</market_553811>\n\n<market_553812>\nMarket ID: 553812\nQuestion: No change in Fed interest rates after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.440\n2025-08-31    0.450\n2025-09-01    0.455\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.445\n2025-09-04    0.440\n2025-09-05    0.355\n2025-09-06    0.425\n2025-09-07    0.410\n2025-09-08    0.400\n2025-09-09    0.390\n2025-09-10    0.310\n2025-09-11    0.265\n2025-09-12    0.265\n2025-09-13    0.260\n2025-09-14    0.215\n2025-09-15    0.215\n2025-09-16    0.195\n2025-09-17    0.200\n2025-09-18    0.145\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.145\n</market_553812>\n\n<market_553813>\nMarket ID: 553813\nQuestion: Fed increases interest rates by 25+ bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0095\n2025-08-31    0.0095\n2025-09-01    0.0085\n2025-09-02    0.0085\n2025-09-03    0.0085\n2025-09-04    0.0085\n2025-09-05    0.0085\n2025-09-06    0.0085\n2025-09-07    0.0085\n2025-09-08    0.0085\n2025-09-09    0.0095\n2025-09-10    0.0090\n2025-09-11    0.0085\n2025-09-12    0.0085\n2025-09-13    0.0085\n2025-09-14    0.0085\n2025-09-15    0.0085\n2025-09-16    0.0085\n2025-09-17    0.0075\n2025-09-18    0.0075\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0075\n</market_553813>\n</available_markets>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n- Use web search to gather up-to-date information about this event\n- Be critical of any sources, and be cautious of sensationalized headlines or partisan sources\n- If some web search results appear to indicate the event's outcome directly, that would be weird because the event should still be unresolved : so double-check that they do not refer to another event, for instance unrelated or long past.\n- Only place a bet when you estimate that the market is mispriced.\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<capital_allocation_rules>\n- You have exactly 1.0 dollars to allocate. Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Performs Google web search and returns top results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The search query to perform.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_webpage: Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Use this tool to validate and return the final event decisions for all relevant markets.\nProvide decisions for all markets you want to bet on.\n    Takes inputs: {'market_decisions': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object'}, 'description': \"List of market decisions.

If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.</market_description>\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0685\n2025-08-31    0.0645\n2025-09-01    0.0650\n2025-09-02    0.0670\n2025-09-03    0.0665\n2025-09-04    0.0720\n2025-09-05    0.0660\n2025-09-06    0.0605\n2025-09-07    0.0520\n2025-09-08    0.0520\n2025-09-09    0.0655\n2025-09-10    0.0840\n2025-09-11    0.1165\n2025-09-12    0.1215\n2025-09-13    0.0870\n2025-09-14    0.1010\n2025-09-15    0.0960\n2025-09-16    0.1070\n2025-09-17    0.1105\n2025-09-18    0.0735\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0735\n</market_553810>\n\n<market_553811>\nMarket ID: 553811\nQuestion: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.470\n2025-08-31    0.470\n2025-09-01    0.475\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.480\n2025-09-04    0.480\n2025-09-05    0.585\n2025-09-06    0.510\n2025-09-07    0.530\n2025-09-08    0.545\n2025-09-09    0.540\n2025-09-10    0.610\n2025-09-11    0.600\n2025-09-12    0.605\n2025-09-13    0.625\n2025-09-14    0.675\n2025-09-15    0.685\n2025-09-16    0.695\n2025-09-17    0.685\n2025-09-18    0.785\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.785\n</market_553811>\n\n<market_553812>\nMarket ID: 553812\nQuestion: No change in Fed interest rates after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.440\n2025-08-31    0.450\n2025-09-01    0.455\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.445\n2025-09-04    0.440\n2025-09-05    0.355\n2025-09-06    0.425\n2025-09-07    0.410\n2025-09-08    0.400\n2025-09-09    0.390\n2025-09-10    0.310\n2025-09-11    0.265\n2025-09-12    0.265\n2025-09-13    0.260\n2025-09-14    0.215\n2025-09-15    0.215\n2025-09-16    0.195\n2025-09-17    0.200\n2025-09-18    0.145\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.145\n</market_553812>\n\n<market_553813>\nMarket ID: 553813\nQuestion: Fed increases interest rates by 25+ bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0095\n2025-08-31    0.0095\n2025-09-01    0.0085\n2025-09-02    0.0085\n2025-09-03    0.0085\n2025-09-04    0.0085\n2025-09-05    0.0085\n2025-09-06    0.0085\n2025-09-07    0.0085\n2025-09-08    0.0085\n2025-09-09    0.0095\n2025-09-10    0.0090\n2025-09-11    0.0085\n2025-09-12    0.0085\n2025-09-13    0.0085\n2025-09-14    0.0085\n2025-09-15    0.0085\n2025-09-16    0.0085\n2025-09-17    0.0075\n2025-09-18    0.0075\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0075\n</market_553813>\n</available_markets>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n- Use web search to gather up-to-date information about this event\n- Be critical of any sources, and be cautious of sensationalized headlines or partisan sources\n- If some web search results appear to indicate the event's outcome directly, that would be weird because the event should still be unresolved : so double-check that they do not refer to another event, for instance unrelated or long past.\n- Only place a bet when you estimate that the market is mispriced.\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<capital_allocation_rules>\n- You have exactly 1.0 dollars to allocate. Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>"

The Federal Reserve, goaded by the risk of rising unemployment, reduced interest rates on Wednesday for the first time since December and indicated more cuts would follow to halt any slide in a [labor market](/business/us-unemployment-rate-near-4-year-high-labor-market-hits-stall-speed-2025-09-05/) already experiencing higher joblessness among Blacks, a declining workweek, and other signs of weakness.\n\nThe decision moves in a direction called for by President Donald Trump, but falls far short of the steep cuts in borrowing costs that he has demanded - and which were apparently penciled into projections submitted by new Fed Governor [Stephen Miran](/world/us/trump-economic-adviser-miran-gets-senate-nod-join-fed-board-2025-09-16/), who cast the only dissenting vote.\n\nGet a daily digest of breaking business news straight to your inbox with the Reuters Business newsletter.

It's not incredibly obvious what to do,\" Powell told reporters at the end of a two-day policy meeting. \"We have to keep our eye on inflation at the same time, we cannot ignore ... maximum employment.\"\n\nPowell said he believes the recent pace of job creation is running below the break-even rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant, and that with businesses doing very little hiring overall, any increase in layoffs could quickly feed into higher unemployment.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\n\"You see minority unemployment going up. You see younger people ... more susceptible to economic cycles ... in addition to just overall lower payroll job creation that shows you that at the margin, the labor market is weakening. ... We don't need it to soften anymore,\" he said.\n\nPowell's comments cap a steady shift in tone that began over the summer as Fed officials concluded that the higher import [tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/) imposed by the Trump administration would not lead to persistent inflation, with faster price increases expected through the end of the year but price pressures also expected to fade after that time even as monetary policy becomes looser.\n\nAt the same time, signs of job market weakness began to accumulate, with payroll growth nearing stall speed.\n\n## MEETING MARKED BY POLITICAL DRAMA\n\nThe decision to cut rates came with no shortage of political drama, with Trump trying to fire Governor [Lisa Cook](/legal/government/us-appeals-court-rejects-trump-bid-oust-feds-lisa-cook-2025-09-16/) in a so-far unsuccessful effort to open another seat on the Fed's Board of Governors for him to fill, and appointing Miran, who is on leave from his job as head of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to an open position that may only last until the end of January.\n\nMiran was sworn in on Tuesday before the meeting started, and dissented against the policy decision in favor of a larger half-percentage-point rate cut. He also seems to have submitted a year-end rate projection implying he supports further half-percentage-point cuts in the meetings ahead, with the policy rate dropping below 3%. The interest rate \"dots\" are not associated with policymakers by name, but new projections showed one forecast far below the others that analysts promptly attributed to Miran.\n\nConcerns that Trump's interference with the Fed - through constant criticism over its rate policy, the appointment of a White House insider to the Fed board and the president's effort to fire Cook - would yield signs of outsized political influence appear to have been overblown for now.\n\n![U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Powell attends a press conference in Washington](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GQMFTT244FNPHMGDONWIS2Q3V4.jpg?auth=3dc21b80449b7c745fa4a23739fc0522a912fe55505999a9abb2c81a8a130d09&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Powell attends a press conference in Washington](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4H5XWNYO5RJ3ZLMRZLMSDM4HHU.jpg?auth=357f0a4e0cd565c388704fd4c13366196d7c3e71497be8443bb628fb94542d80&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve, in Washington](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YUVZCMM23JMKFM5RGWSMCOFUG4.jpg?auth=12149d463072ad1874e4ea101f03b9e91009e90631c974126c92c64536974497&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve, in Washington](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DQB5ISARN5JMTHE4COZYQLRHOI.jpg?auth=845f25831342aba44beccd1b78b5a878f734c7e8d03745f994ee286e88ac0e07&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve, in Washington](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RZBCO2B6J5IWZPRK5UP7F2MBSE.jpg?auth=73dd61a8936085197fd0f48ff4363aec3108dde88e5f19933d053a11666e0bbc&width=1080&quality=80)\n\nItem 5 of 5 A Federal Reserve seal, during the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve, in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 17, 2025.

Putnam Investment Management.\n\nPowell said it was not so much the initial cut that will matter to the economy, but the broader sense of a rate path that moves slightly faster to a stopping point about a quarter of a percentage point lower than officials communicated in their projections in June.\n\nThe rate-path views are not commitments, Powell said, with higher inflation still a risk and the central bank now in a \"meeting-by-meeting situation\" when it comes to further rate reductions.\n\nBut \"I do think the Fed will ultimately keep moving towards neutral,\" even at the expense of slightly higher inflation through 2026, said Christopher Hodge, chief U.S. economist at Natixis.\n\nNew economic projections released by the Fed showed policymakers at the median still see inflation ending this year at 3%, well above the central bank's 2% target, a projection unchanged from the forecasts in June. The projection for unemployment was also unchanged at 4.5% and the one for economic growth slightly higher at 1.6% versus 1.4%.\n\nStocks briefly rose after the release of the policy decision and projections before turning lower and [closing mixed](/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/wall-street-ends-mixed-trade-choppy-after-feds-rate-cut-outlook-2025-09-17/), while the dollar was modestly higher against a basket of major trading partners' currencies. Treasury yields were little changed and rate futures markets saw more than a 90% probability of another rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in late October.\n\nAmong those voting in favor of the policy decision was Cook, who attended the meeting despite Trump's effort to fire her and after two courts supported her challenge of his attempted dismissal.\n\nReporting by Howard Schneider and Ann Saphir; Additional reporting by Saeed Azhar and Chuck Mikolajczak in New York; Editing Andrea Ricci and Paul Simao\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n* Suggested Topics:\n* [Macro Matters](/markets/macromatters/)\n\nShare\n\n* X\n* Facebook\n* Linkedin\n* Email\n* Link\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[![Howard Schneider](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fauthor-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub%2Freuters%2Fa7e1c96c-b8d4-471b-b2bd-8e0696bb5652.png?auth=bc81f99a78226c62ec41fc3af07af6a4230584f2e7babda8d4576cf858e39bf3&width=120&quality=80)](/authors/howard-schneider/)\n\n[Howard Schneider](/authors/howard-schneider/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nCovers the U.S. Federal Reserve, monetary policy and the economy, a graduate of the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University with previous experience as a foreign correspondent, economics reporter and on the local staff of the Washington Post.\n\n* [Email](mailto:Howard.Schneider@thomsonreuters.com)\n* [X](https://x.com/hpschneider)\n\n[![Ann Saphir](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Farc-authors%2Freuters%2F53fcece9-dce4-44b3-b1de-f55a1dd379c0.png?auth=47423f6e0593ceffd80d8c878ded06096ad9b596256081a94042d438ca82cda3&width=120&quality=80)](/authors/ann-saphir/)\n\n[Ann Saphir](/authors/ann-saphir/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nReports on the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy.

              "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"web_search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Performs Google web search and returns top results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The search query to perform.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_webpage: Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Use this tool to validate and return the final event decisions for all relevant markets.\nProvide decisions for all markets you want to bet on.\n    Takes inputs: {'market_decisions': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object'}, 'description': \"List of market decisions. Each dict should contain: 1. market_id (str): The market ID 2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't. 3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate) 4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high). 5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\"}, 'unallocated_capital': {'type': 'number', 'description': 'Fraction of capital not allocated to any bet (0.0 to 1.0)'}}\n    Returns an output of type: array\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin!"

Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>"

The Federal Reserve, goaded by the risk of rising unemployment, reduced interest rates on Wednesday for the first time since December and indicated more cuts would follow to halt any slide in a [labor market](/business/us-unemployment-rate-near-4-year-high-labor-market-hits-stall-speed-2025-09-05/) already experiencing higher joblessness among Blacks, a declining workweek, and other signs of weakness.\n\nThe decision moves in a direction called for by President Donald Trump, but falls far short of the steep cuts in borrowing costs that he has demanded - and which were apparently penciled into projections submitted by new Fed Governor [Stephen Miran](/world/us/trump-economic-adviser-miran-gets-senate-nod-join-fed-board-2025-09-16/), who cast the only dissenting vote.\n\nGet a daily digest of breaking business news straight to your inbox with the Reuters Business newsletter.

It's not incredibly obvious what to do,\" Powell told reporters at the end of a two-day policy meeting. \"We have to keep our eye on inflation at the same time, we cannot ignore ... maximum employment.\"\n\nPowell said he believes the recent pace of job creation is running below the break-even rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant, and that with businesses doing very little hiring overall, any increase in layoffs could quickly feed into higher unemployment.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\n\"You see minority unemployment going up. You see younger people ... more susceptible to economic cycles ... in addition to just overall lower payroll job creation that shows you that at the margin, the labor market is weakening. ... We don't need it to soften anymore,\" he said.\n\nPowell's comments cap a steady shift in tone that began over the summer as Fed officials concluded that the higher import [tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/) imposed by the Trump administration would not lead to persistent inflation, with faster price increases expected through the end of the year but price pressures also expected to fade after that time even as monetary policy becomes looser.\n\nAt the same time, signs of job market weakness began to accumulate, with payroll growth nearing stall speed.\n\n## MEETING MARKED BY POLITICAL DRAMA\n\nThe decision to cut rates came with no shortage of political drama, with Trump trying to fire Governor [Lisa Cook](/legal/government/us-appeals-court-rejects-trump-bid-oust-feds-lisa-cook-2025-09-16/) in a so-far unsuccessful effort to open another seat on the Fed's Board of Governors for him to fill, and appointing Miran, who is on leave from his job as head of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to an open position that may only last until the end of January.\n\nMiran was sworn in on Tuesday before the meeting started, and dissented against the policy decision in favor of a larger half-percentage-point rate cut. He also seems to have submitted a year-end rate projection implying he supports further half-percentage-point cuts in the meetings ahead, with the policy rate dropping below 3%. The interest rate \"dots\" are not associated with policymakers by name, but new projections showed one forecast far below the others that analysts promptly attributed to Miran.\n\nConcerns that Trump's interference with the Fed - through constant criticism over its rate policy, the appointment of a White House insider to the Fed board and the president's effort to fire Cook - would yield signs of outsized political influence appear to have been overblown for now.\n\n![U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Powell attends a press conference in Washington](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GQMFTT244FNPHMGDONWIS2Q3V4.jpg?auth=3dc21b80449b7c745fa4a23739fc0522a912fe55505999a9abb2c81a8a130d09&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Powell attends a press conference in Washington](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4H5XWNYO5RJ3ZLMRZLMSDM4HHU.jpg?auth=357f0a4e0cd565c388704fd4c13366196d7c3e71497be8443bb628fb94542d80&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve, in Washington](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YUVZCMM23JMKFM5RGWSMCOFUG4.jpg?auth=12149d463072ad1874e4ea101f03b9e91009e90631c974126c92c64536974497&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve, in Washington](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DQB5ISARN5JMTHE4COZYQLRHOI.jpg?auth=845f25831342aba44beccd1b78b5a878f734c7e8d03745f994ee286e88ac0e07&width=1080&quality=80)\n\n![Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve, in Washington](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RZBCO2B6J5IWZPRK5UP7F2MBSE.jpg?auth=73dd61a8936085197fd0f48ff4363aec3108dde88e5f19933d053a11666e0bbc&width=1080&quality=80)\n\nItem 5 of 5 A Federal Reserve seal, during the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve, in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 17, 2025.

Putnam Investment Management.\n\nPowell said it was not so much the initial cut that will matter to the economy, but the broader sense of a rate path that moves slightly faster to a stopping point about a quarter of a percentage point lower than officials communicated in their projections in June.\n\nThe rate-path views are not commitments, Powell said, with higher inflation still a risk and the central bank now in a \"meeting-by-meeting situation\" when it comes to further rate reductions.\n\nBut \"I do think the Fed will ultimately keep moving towards neutral,\" even at the expense of slightly higher inflation through 2026, said Christopher Hodge, chief U.S. economist at Natixis.\n\nNew economic projections released by the Fed showed policymakers at the median still see inflation ending this year at 3%, well above the central bank's 2% target, a projection unchanged from the forecasts in June. The projection for unemployment was also unchanged at 4.5% and the one for economic growth slightly higher at 1.6% versus 1.4%.\n\nStocks briefly rose after the release of the policy decision and projections before turning lower and [closing mixed](/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/wall-street-ends-mixed-trade-choppy-after-feds-rate-cut-outlook-2025-09-17/), while the dollar was modestly higher against a basket of major trading partners' currencies. Treasury yields were little changed and rate futures markets saw more than a 90% probability of another rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in late October.\n\nAmong those voting in favor of the policy decision was Cook, who attended the meeting despite Trump's effort to fire her and after two courts supported her challenge of his attempted dismissal.\n\nReporting by Howard Schneider and Ann Saphir; Additional reporting by Saeed Azhar and Chuck Mikolajczak in New York; Editing Andrea Ricci and Paul Simao\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n* Suggested Topics:\n* [Macro Matters](/markets/macromatters/)\n\nShare\n\n* X\n* Facebook\n* Linkedin\n* Email\n* Link\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[![Howard Schneider](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fauthor-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub%2Freuters%2Fa7e1c96c-b8d4-471b-b2bd-8e0696bb5652.png?auth=bc81f99a78226c62ec41fc3af07af6a4230584f2e7babda8d4576cf858e39bf3&width=120&quality=80)](/authors/howard-schneider/)\n\n[Howard Schneider](/authors/howard-schneider/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nCovers the U.S. Federal Reserve, monetary policy and the economy, a graduate of the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University with previous experience as a foreign correspondent, economics reporter and on the local staff of the Washington Post.\n\n* [Email](mailto:Howard.Schneider@thomsonreuters.com)\n* [X](https://x.com/hpschneider)\n\n[![Ann Saphir](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Farc-authors%2Freuters%2F53fcece9-dce4-44b3-b1de-f55a1dd379c0.png?auth=47423f6e0593ceffd80d8c878ded06096ad9b596256081a94042d438ca82cda3&width=120&quality=80)](/authors/ann-saphir/)\n\n[Ann Saphir](/authors/ann-saphir/)\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nReports on the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy.
