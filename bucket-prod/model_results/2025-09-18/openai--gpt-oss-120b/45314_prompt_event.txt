<analysis_guidelines>
- Use web search to gather up-to-date information about this event
- Be critical of any sources, and be cautious of sensationalized headlines or partisan sources
- If some web search results appear to indicate the event's outcome directly, that would be weird because the event should still be unresolved : so double-check that they do not refer to another event, for instance unrelated or long past.
- Only place a bet when you estimate that the market is mispriced.
</analysis_guidelines>

<capital_allocation_rules>
- You have exactly 1.0 dollars to allocate. Use the "bet" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.
- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:
1. market_id (str): The market ID
2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.
3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)
4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).
5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)
- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.
- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.
