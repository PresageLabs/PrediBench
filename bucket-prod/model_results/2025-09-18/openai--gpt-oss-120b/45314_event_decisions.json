        "rationale": "The game has already been completed (Brewers 9, Angels 2). The combined run total was 11, which is above the 7.5 over/under line, so the Over outcome is certain (probability = 1). The market price for Over is 0.82, implying an implied probability of 82%. Because the true probability is 100% and the market is pricing it at only 82%, the contract is undervalued by 18%. Buying the Over contract therefore has an expected value of 1 - 0.82 = 0.18 per dollar staked, the highest EV among the available markets. With absolute certainty of the outcome we can place the full $1 capital here for the maximal expected profit.",

Since the Brewers won, the true probability of the Brewers outcome is 1. The market undervalues the Brewers side by 3.55% (EV = 0.0355 per dollar).
