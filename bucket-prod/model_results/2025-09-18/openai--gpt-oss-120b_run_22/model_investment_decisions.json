            "rationale": "The market currently prices a 78.5% probability that the Fed will cut the policy rate by 25 bps at the October 2025 meeting. Recent developments – a 25 bps cut at the September 16‑17 meeting and multiple statements from Fed officials indicating a willingness to ease further – suggest the Fed is on an easing path, but the September cut already delivered the first quarter‑point reduction of the cycle. Historically, after an initial cut, the Fed often pauses before delivering a second identical cut, especially when inflation is still above target. Moreover, the median dot‑plot now projects only two more cuts for the remainder of 2025, implying the October meeting may be a pause point. Hence I estimate the true probability of a 25 bps cut at about 70 % – lower than the market’s implied 78.5 %. I therefore short this outcome.",

Given the recent 25 bps reduction in September and the Fed’s expressed desire to keep inflation moving toward 2% while maintaining financial stability, a modest pause is plausible. The Fed’s own projections (dot‑plot) still allow for a pause in the October meeting before resuming cuts later in the year. Combining those factors, I assess a 20% probability of no change – higher than the market’s implied 14.5% – indicating underpricing. I therefore go long on the \"no change\" outcome.",

Recent statements and the modest 25 bps cut just taken suggest the Fed is unlikely to deliver a deep cut this month; the Fed’s minutes from September show only a few participants supporting a larger move, and the median projection still shows only two more cuts of 25 bps each for the rest of 2025.
