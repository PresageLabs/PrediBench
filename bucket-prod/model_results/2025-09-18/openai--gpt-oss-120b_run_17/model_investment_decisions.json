The September meeting was the first cut in nine months, and Fed officials have signaled that additional quarter‑point reductions are likely at the October and December meetings. While a 25‑bps cut is now priced at about 78.5% (price 0.785), a 50‑bps cut is priced at only 7.35% (price 0.0735). Given the strong narrative for continued easing but the rarity of a double‑quarter‑point move in a single meeting, a 10‑15% chance of a 50‑bps cut seems reasonable. This suggests the market is undervaluing the 50+ bps cut outcome. I therefore place a modest positive bet.\n",
