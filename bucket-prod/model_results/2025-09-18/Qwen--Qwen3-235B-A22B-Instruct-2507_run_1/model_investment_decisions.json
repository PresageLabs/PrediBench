The median dot plot projection suggests only 50 bps of total cuts by year-end (from current 4.125% to 3.6%), which is more consistent with two 25 bps cuts in October and December. A 50 bps cut would require a sharp deterioration in labor or inflation data, which is not currently evident. One outlier (Miran) suggests deeper easing, but this does not represent the majority view. Therefore, I estimate the true probability is 5%, and the market is slightly overpriced. I take a small negative bet.",

The September 2025 statement signaled 'more cuts are likely,' and the dot plot shows broad support for easing. No participant projects a rate above 4% by year-end, ruling out skip or hike. Given this strong directional guidance, I estimate an 85% probability of a 25 bps cut. The market is undervaluing this outcome.

The median funds rate projection (3.6% by end-2025) from the dot plot makes 'no change' inconsistent with the path.

Not a single participant in the dot plot projects a rate hike. The risks to inflation are 'weighted to the upside,' but the Fed has already begun cutting due to labor market normalization.
