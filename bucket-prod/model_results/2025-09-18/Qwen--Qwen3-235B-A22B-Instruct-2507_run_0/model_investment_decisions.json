This would represent the first of two expected cuts. The current price of $0.0735 is irrational given that markets are pricing in continued easing. The Fed is responding to job market concerns, making a more substantial cut likely to be proactive.

The dot plot shows two more cuts this year, making a 25 bps cut in October followed by another 25 bps cut later less probable than a more front-loaded approach. The market has overreacted to the recent 25 bps cut and failed to price in the Fed's dovish pivot and 'risk management' approach mentioned by Powell.

The FOMC's explicit statement about lowering rates for the rest of the year, coupled with Powell's 'risk management' cut rationale and evidence of a weakening job market, makes no change extremely unlikely. The dot plot showing two more cuts this year further confirms this assessment. While the market accounts for some uncertainty, $0.145 is still too high given the clear dovish tilt in Fed guidance.
