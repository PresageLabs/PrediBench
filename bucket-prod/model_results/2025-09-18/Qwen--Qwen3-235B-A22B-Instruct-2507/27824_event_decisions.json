  "event_description": "The FED interest rates are defined in this market by the upper bound of the target federal funds range. The decisions on the target federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.\n\nThis market will resolve to the amount of basis points the upper bound of the target federal funds rate is changed by versus the level it was prior to the Federal Reserve's October 2025 meeting.\n\nIf the target federal funds rate is changed to a level not expressed in the displayed options, the change will be rounded up to the nearest 25 and will resolve to the relevant bracket. (e.g. if there's a cut/increase of 12.5 bps it will be considered to be 25 bps)\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC’s statement after its meeting scheduled for October 28 - 29, 2025 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC’s statement for their October meeting with relevant data is issued. If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.\n",

        "rationale": "The market for a 50+ bps rate cut is currently priced at 7.35%, but actual likelihood is low. While the Fed projects ~50-60 bps of cuts by year-end, it is more likely to be split across October and December. A 50+ bps cut in October alone would be highly aggressive and disruptive, and no FOMC member has signaled such a move. Therefore, the 'Yes' outcome is unlikely. However, it is not zero, so a small short position is justified.",

With only October and December meetings left, a 25 bps cut in October is the base case. Multiple statements signal a 'gradual, data-dependent' approach. This outcome is slightly underpriced: my estimate is 85%. With high confidence, this justifies a strong long bet.",

The FOMC just cut rates and signaled at least one more cut. A pause in October is possible, but unlikely. Market overestimates uncertainty.
