Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>",

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use Python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your Python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\"))\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using Python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove examples were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs Google web search and returns top results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(market_decisions: array, unallocated_capital: number) -> array:\n    \"\"\"Use this tool to validate and return the final event decisions for all relevant markets.\n    Provide decisions for all markets you want to bet on.\n\n    Args:\n        market_decisions: List of market decisions. Each dict should contain: 1. market_id (str): The market ID 2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't. 3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate) 4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high). 5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n        unallocated_capital: Fraction of capital not allocated to any bet (0.0 to 1.0)\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.</market_description>\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0685\n2025-08-31    0.0645\n2025-09-01    0.0650\n2025-09-02    0.0670\n2025-09-03    0.0665\n2025-09-04    0.0720\n2025-09-05    0.0660\n2025-09-06    0.0605\n2025-09-07    0.0520\n2025-09-08    0.0520\n2025-09-09    0.0655\n2025-09-10    0.0840\n2025-09-11    0.1165\n2025-09-12    0.1215\n2025-09-13    0.0870\n2025-09-14    0.1010\n2025-09-15    0.0960\n2025-09-16    0.1070\n2025-09-17    0.1105\n2025-09-18    0.0735\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0735\n</market_553810>\n\n<market_553811>\nMarket ID: 553811\nQuestion: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.470\n2025-08-31    0.470\n2025-09-01    0.475\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.480\n2025-09-04    0.480\n2025-09-05    0.585\n2025-09-06    0.510\n2025-09-07    0.530\n2025-09-08    0.545\n2025-09-09    0.540\n2025-09-10    0.610\n2025-09-11    0.600\n2025-09-12    0.605\n2025-09-13    0.625\n2025-09-14    0.675\n2025-09-15    0.685\n2025-09-16    0.695\n2025-09-17    0.685\n2025-09-18    0.785\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.785\n</market_553811>\n\n<market_553812>\nMarket ID: 553812\nQuestion: No change in Fed interest rates after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.440\n2025-08-31    0.450\n2025-09-01    0.455\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.445\n2025-09-04    0.440\n2025-09-05    0.355\n2025-09-06    0.425\n2025-09-07    0.410\n2025-09-08    0.400\n2025-09-09    0.390\n2025-09-10    0.310\n2025-09-11    0.265\n2025-09-12    0.265\n2025-09-13    0.260\n2025-09-14    0.215\n2025-09-15    0.215\n2025-09-16    0.195\n2025-09-17    0.200\n2025-09-18    0.145\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.145\n</market_553812>\n\n<market_553813>\nMarket ID: 553813\nQuestion: Fed increases interest rates by 25+ bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0095\n2025-08-31    0.0095\n2025-09-01    0.0085\n2025-09-02    0.0085\n2025-09-03    0.0085\n2025-09-04    0.0085\n2025-09-05    0.0085\n2025-09-06    0.0085\n2025-09-07    0.0085\n2025-09-08    0.0085\n2025-09-09    0.0095\n2025-09-10    0.0090\n2025-09-11    0.0085\n2025-09-12    0.0085\n2025-09-13    0.0085\n2025-09-14    0.0085\n2025-09-15    0.0085\n2025-09-16    0.0085\n2025-09-17    0.0075\n2025-09-18    0.0075\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0075\n</market_553813>\n</available_markets>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n- Use web search to gather up-to-date information about this event\n- Be critical of any sources, and be cautious of sensationalized headlines or partisan sources\n- If some web search results appear to indicate the event's outcome directly, that would be weird because the event should still be unresolved : so double-check that they do not refer to another event, for instance unrelated or long past.\n- Only place a bet when you estimate that the market is mispriced.\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<capital_allocation_rules>\n- You have exactly 1.0 dollars to allocate. Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use Python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>"

Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections.

Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as “broadly balanced” would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\n\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n\n\\* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\n\n#### Table 2.

As described in the box \"Forecast Uncertainty,\" under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), [https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020](https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020 \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach\").\n\n1.

For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. [Return to table](#t2f3r)\n\n#### Forecast Uncertainty\n\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur.\n\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past *Monetary Policy Reports* and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board's staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, espectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.7 to 5.3 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second year and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \"fan charts\" that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants' projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\n\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\n\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\n\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\n\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\n\n[Back to Top](# \"Scroll To Top\")\n\nLast Update:\nSeptember 17, 2025\n\n\n\n###### Board of Governors *of the* Federal Reserve System\n\n* [About the Fed](/aboutthefed.htm)\n* [News & Events](/newsevents.htm)\n* [Monetary Policy](/monetarypolicy.htm)\n* [Supervision & Regulation](/supervisionreg.htm)\n* [Financial Stability](/financial-stability.htm)\n* [Payment Systems](/paymentsystems.htm)\n* [Economic Research](/econres.htm)\n* [Data](/data.htm)\n* [Consumers & Communities](/consumerscommunities.htm)\n* [Connect with the Board](/aboutthefed/aroundtheboard/stayconnected-qr-code-2.htm)\n\n###### Tools and Information\n\n* [Contact](/aboutthefed/contact-us-topics.htm)\n* [Publications](/publications.htm)\n* [Freedom of Information (FOIA)](/foia/about_foia.htm)\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://oig.federalreserve.gov/)\n* [Budget & Performance](/publications/annual-report.htm) | [Audit](/regreform/audit.htm)\n* [No FEAR Act](/eeo.htm)\n* [Español](/espanol.htm)\n* [Website Policies](/website-linking-policies.htm) | [Privacy Program](/privacy.htm)\n* [Accessibility](/accessibility.htm)\n\n###### Stay Connected\n\n[Federal Reserve Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/federalreserve)\n[Federal Reserve Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/federalreserveboard/)\n[Federal Reserve YouTube Page](https://www.youtube.com/federalreserve)\n[Federal Reserve Flickr Page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/federalreserve/)\n[Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/federal-reserve-board)\n[Federal Reserve Threads Page](https://www.threads.net/@federalreserveboard)\n[Link to Federal Reserve X Page](https://x.com/federalreserve)\n[Link to Federal Reserve Bluesky Page](https://bsky.app/profile/federalreserve.gov)\n[Subscribe to RSS](/feeds/feeds.htm)\n[Subscribe to Email](/subscribe.htm)\n\n[![Link to USA.gov](/images/USAGov%402x.png)](https://www.usa.gov/ \"Link to USA.gov\")\n[![Link to Open.gov](/images/OpenGov%402x.png)](/open/open.htm \"Link to Open.gov\")\n\nBoard of Governors *of the* Federal Reserve System\n\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551\nLast output from code snippet:\nNone",

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use Python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your Python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\"))\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using Python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove examples were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs Google web search and returns top results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(market_decisions: array, unallocated_capital: number) -> array:\n    \"\"\"Use this tool to validate and return the final event decisions for all relevant markets.\n    Provide decisions for all markets you want to bet on.\n\n    Args:\n        market_decisions: List of market decisions. Each dict should contain: 1. market_id (str): The market ID 2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't. 3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate) 4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high). 5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n        unallocated_capital: Fraction of capital not allocated to any bet (0.0 to 1.0)\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

              "text": "Thought: The search results indicate that the Federal Reserve just cut interest rates by 25 basis points on September 17, 2025, lowering the federal funds rate to a range of 4.00%–4.25%. Crucially, multiple sources state that the Fed signaled more rate cuts are likely in 2025. The \"dot plot\" (FOMC projections) suggests two additional cuts for the remainder of 2025. This means a 25 bps cut in October 2025 is widely expected, with possible further cuts thereafter.\n\nThis provides critical insight into market expectations for the **October 2025** FOMC meeting. Let's now check the official Federal Reserve website or a more detailed analysis to verify the projected path for rates in October 2025, specifically looking for data beyond the September cut. I will visit the FOMC projections page for details.\n<code>\ndot_plot_page = visit_webpage(\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20250917.htm\")\nprint(dot_plot_page)\n</code>"

The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\n\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n\n\\* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\n\n#### Table 2.

As described in the box \"Forecast Uncertainty,\" under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), [https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020](https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020 \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach\").\n\n1.

For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. [Return to table](#t2f3r)\n\n#### Forecast Uncertainty\n\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur.\n\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past *Monetary Policy Reports* and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board's staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, espectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.7 to 5.3 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second year and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \"fan charts\" that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants' projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\n\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\n\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\n\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\n\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\n\n[Back to Top](# \"Scroll To Top\")\n\nLast Update:\nSeptember 17, 2025\n\n\n\n###### Board of Governors *of the* Federal Reserve System\n\n* [About the Fed](/aboutthefed.htm)\n* [News & Events](/newsevents.htm)\n* [Monetary Policy](/monetarypolicy.htm)\n* [Supervision & Regulation](/supervisionreg.htm)\n* [Financial Stability](/financial-stability.htm)\n* [Payment Systems](/paymentsystems.htm)\n* [Economic Research](/econres.htm)\n* [Data](/data.htm)\n* [Consumers & Communities](/consumerscommunities.htm)\n* [Connect with the Board](/aboutthefed/aroundtheboard/stayconnected-qr-code-2.htm)\n\n###### Tools and Information\n\n* [Contact](/aboutthefed/contact-us-topics.htm)\n* [Publications](/publications.htm)\n* [Freedom of Information (FOIA)](/foia/about_foia.htm)\n* [Office of Inspector General](https://oig.federalreserve.gov/)\n* [Budget & Performance](/publications/annual-report.htm) | [Audit](/regreform/audit.htm)\n* [No FEAR Act](/eeo.htm)\n* [Español](/espanol.htm)\n* [Website Policies](/website-linking-policies.htm) | [Privacy Program](/privacy.htm)\n* [Accessibility](/accessibility.htm)\n\n###### Stay Connected\n\n[Federal Reserve Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/federalreserve)\n[Federal Reserve Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/federalreserveboard/)\n[Federal Reserve YouTube Page](https://www.youtube.com/federalreserve)\n[Federal Reserve Flickr Page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/federalreserve/)\n[Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/federal-reserve-board)\n[Federal Reserve Threads Page](https://www.threads.net/@federalreserveboard)\n[Link to Federal Reserve X Page](https://x.com/federalreserve)\n[Link to Federal Reserve Bluesky Page](https://bsky.app/profile/federalreserve.gov)\n[Subscribe to RSS](/feeds/feeds.htm)\n[Subscribe to Email](/subscribe.htm)\n\n[![Link to USA.gov](/images/USAGov%402x.png)](https://www.usa.gov/ \"Link to USA.gov\")\n[![Link to Open.gov](/images/OpenGov%402x.png)](/open/open.htm \"Link to Open.gov\")\n\nBoard of Governors *of the* Federal Reserve System\n\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551\nLast output from code snippet:\nNone"
