  "event_description": "The FED interest rates are defined in this market by the upper bound of the target federal funds range. The decisions on the target federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.\n\nThis market will resolve to the amount of basis points the upper bound of the target federal funds rate is changed by versus the level it was prior to the Federal Reserve's October 2025 meeting.\n\nIf the target federal funds rate is changed to a level not expressed in the displayed options, the change will be rounded up to the nearest 25 and will resolve to the relevant bracket. (e.g. if there's a cut/increase of 12.5 bps it will be considered to be 25 bps)\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC’s statement after its meeting scheduled for October 28 - 29, 2025 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC’s statement for their October meeting with relevant data is issued. If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.\n",

        "rationale": "The market is pricing in only a 7.35% chance of a 50+ bps cut in October. While Governor Miran dissented in favor of a larger cut, the majority of the FOMC appears to favor a more gradual approach. The Fed's guidance suggests two more cuts for the year, which would be 25 bps each to reach the 3.50%-3.75% range by year-end. A 50+ bps cut would be aggressive and inconsistent with this guidance. The market seems reasonably priced, but there's a slight possibility of a larger cut if economic data deteriorates significantly before the October meeting. However, with only limited time for new data before the October meeting, this seems unlikely.",

Given that the Fed just cut rates in September and explicitly guided to two more cuts in 2025, this seems like the most likely scenario. The current federal funds rate is 4.00%-4.25%, and reaching the 3.50%-3.75% range by year-end would require two 25 bps cuts. The economic conditions (weakening labor market, inflation still above target) support a cautious rate cut. The market seems fairly priced, but there's a slight edge in favor of this outcome given the Fed's explicit guidance.",

Given the Fed's explicit guidance for two more cuts in 2025 and the recent September cut, this seems very unlikely. The economic data (weakening labor market) supports some policy easing. While it's possible that unexpectedly strong data could cause the Fed to pause, the September meeting already digested the recent economic data, making a pause in October unlikely. The market seems to be correctly pricing in a low probability for this outcome.",

Given the current economic conditions (weakening labor market, softening consumer spending) and the Fed's recent easing cycle initiation, a rate increase is extremely unlikely. The Fed just began cutting rates and signaled more cuts ahead. Inflation, while still above target, is not surging. There's virtually no scenario where the Fed would raise rates in October 2025.
