Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>",

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use Python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your Python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\"))\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using Python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove examples were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs Google web search and returns top results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(market_decisions: array, unallocated_capital: number) -> array:\n    \"\"\"Use this tool to validate and return the final event decisions for all relevant markets.\n    Provide decisions for all markets you want to bet on.\n\n    Args:\n        market_decisions: List of market decisions. Each dict should contain: 1. market_id (str): The market ID 2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't. 3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate) 4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high). 5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n        unallocated_capital: Fraction of capital not allocated to any bet (0.0 to 1.0)\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.</market_description>\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0685\n2025-08-31    0.0645\n2025-09-01    0.0650\n2025-09-02    0.0670\n2025-09-03    0.0665\n2025-09-04    0.0720\n2025-09-05    0.0660\n2025-09-06    0.0605\n2025-09-07    0.0520\n2025-09-08    0.0520\n2025-09-09    0.0655\n2025-09-10    0.0840\n2025-09-11    0.1165\n2025-09-12    0.1215\n2025-09-13    0.0870\n2025-09-14    0.1010\n2025-09-15    0.0960\n2025-09-16    0.1070\n2025-09-17    0.1105\n2025-09-18    0.0735\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0735\n</market_553810>\n\n<market_553811>\nMarket ID: 553811\nQuestion: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.470\n2025-08-31    0.470\n2025-09-01    0.475\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.480\n2025-09-04    0.480\n2025-09-05    0.585\n2025-09-06    0.510\n2025-09-07    0.530\n2025-09-08    0.545\n2025-09-09    0.540\n2025-09-10    0.610\n2025-09-11    0.600\n2025-09-12    0.605\n2025-09-13    0.625\n2025-09-14    0.675\n2025-09-15    0.685\n2025-09-16    0.695\n2025-09-17    0.685\n2025-09-18    0.785\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.785\n</market_553811>\n\n<market_553812>\nMarket ID: 553812\nQuestion: No change in Fed interest rates after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.440\n2025-08-31    0.450\n2025-09-01    0.455\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.445\n2025-09-04    0.440\n2025-09-05    0.355\n2025-09-06    0.425\n2025-09-07    0.410\n2025-09-08    0.400\n2025-09-09    0.390\n2025-09-10    0.310\n2025-09-11    0.265\n2025-09-12    0.265\n2025-09-13    0.260\n2025-09-14    0.215\n2025-09-15    0.215\n2025-09-16    0.195\n2025-09-17    0.200\n2025-09-18    0.145\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.145\n</market_553812>\n\n<market_553813>\nMarket ID: 553813\nQuestion: Fed increases interest rates by 25+ bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0095\n2025-08-31    0.0095\n2025-09-01    0.0085\n2025-09-02    0.0085\n2025-09-03    0.0085\n2025-09-04    0.0085\n2025-09-05    0.0085\n2025-09-06    0.0085\n2025-09-07    0.0085\n2025-09-08    0.0085\n2025-09-09    0.0095\n2025-09-10    0.0090\n2025-09-11    0.0085\n2025-09-12    0.0085\n2025-09-13    0.0085\n2025-09-14    0.0085\n2025-09-15    0.0085\n2025-09-16    0.0085\n2025-09-17    0.0075\n2025-09-18    0.0075\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0075\n</market_553813>\n</available_markets>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n- Use web search to gather up-to-date information about this event\n- Be critical of any sources, and be cautious of sensationalized headlines or partisan sources\n- If some web search results appear to indicate the event's outcome directly, that would be weird because the event should still be unresolved : so double-check that they do not refer to another event, for instance unrelated or long past.\n- Only place a bet when you estimate that the market is mispriced.\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<capital_allocation_rules>\n- You have exactly 1.0 dollars to allocate. Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use Python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>"

              "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use Python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your Python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\"))\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using Python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove examples were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs Google web search and returns top results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(market_decisions: array, unallocated_capital: number) -> array:\n    \"\"\"Use this tool to validate and return the final event decisions for all relevant markets.\n    Provide decisions for all markets you want to bet on.\n\n    Args:\n        market_decisions: List of market decisions. Each dict should contain: 1. market_id (str): The market ID 2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't. 3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate) 4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high). 5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n        unallocated_capital: Fraction of capital not allocated to any bet (0.0 to 1.0)\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet.

Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>"

              "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use Python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your Python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\"))\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using Python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove examples were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs Google web search and returns top results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(market_decisions: array, unallocated_capital: number) -> array:\n    \"\"\"Use this tool to validate and return the final event decisions for all relevant markets.\n    Provide decisions for all markets you want to bet on.\n\n    Args:\n        market_decisions: List of market decisions. Each dict should contain: 1. market_id (str): The market ID 2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't. 3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate) 4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high). 5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n        unallocated_capital: Fraction of capital not allocated to any bet (0.0 to 1.0)\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>"

              "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use Python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your Python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\"))\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using Python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove examples were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs Google web search and returns top results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(market_decisions: array, unallocated_capital: number) -> array:\n    \"\"\"Use this tool to validate and return the final event decisions for all relevant markets.\n    Provide decisions for all markets you want to bet on.\n\n    Args:\n        market_decisions: List of market decisions. Each dict should contain: 1. market_id (str): The market ID 2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't. 3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate) 4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high). 5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n        unallocated_capital: Fraction of capital not allocated to any bet (0.0 to 1.0)\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.</market_description>\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0685\n2025-08-31    0.0645\n2025-09-01    0.0650\n2025-09-02    0.0670\n2025-09-03    0.0665\n2025-09-04    0.0720\n2025-09-05    0.0660\n2025-09-06    0.0605\n2025-09-07    0.0520\n2025-09-08    0.0520\n2025-09-09    0.0655\n2025-09-10    0.0840\n2025-09-11    0.1165\n2025-09-12    0.1215\n2025-09-13    0.0870\n2025-09-14    0.1010\n2025-09-15    0.0960\n2025-09-16    0.1070\n2025-09-17    0.1105\n2025-09-18    0.0735\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0735\n</market_553810>\n\n<market_553811>\nMarket ID: 553811\nQuestion: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.470\n2025-08-31    0.470\n2025-09-01    0.475\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.480\n2025-09-04    0.480\n2025-09-05    0.585\n2025-09-06    0.510\n2025-09-07    0.530\n2025-09-08    0.545\n2025-09-09    0.540\n2025-09-10    0.610\n2025-09-11    0.600\n2025-09-12    0.605\n2025-09-13    0.625\n2025-09-14    0.675\n2025-09-15    0.685\n2025-09-16    0.695\n2025-09-17    0.685\n2025-09-18    0.785\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.785\n</market_553811>\n\n<market_553812>\nMarket ID: 553812\nQuestion: No change in Fed interest rates after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.440\n2025-08-31    0.450\n2025-09-01    0.455\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.445\n2025-09-04    0.440\n2025-09-05    0.355\n2025-09-06    0.425\n2025-09-07    0.410\n2025-09-08    0.400\n2025-09-09    0.390\n2025-09-10    0.310\n2025-09-11    0.265\n2025-09-12    0.265\n2025-09-13    0.260\n2025-09-14    0.215\n2025-09-15    0.215\n2025-09-16    0.195\n2025-09-17    0.200\n2025-09-18    0.145\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.145\n</market_553812>\n\n<market_553813>\nMarket ID: 553813\nQuestion: Fed increases interest rates by 25+ bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0095\n2025-08-31    0.0095\n2025-09-01    0.0085\n2025-09-02    0.0085\n2025-09-03    0.0085\n2025-09-04    0.0085\n2025-09-05    0.0085\n2025-09-06    0.0085\n2025-09-07    0.0085\n2025-09-08    0.0085\n2025-09-09    0.0095\n2025-09-10    0.0090\n2025-09-11    0.0085\n2025-09-12    0.0085\n2025-09-13    0.0085\n2025-09-14    0.0085\n2025-09-15    0.0085\n2025-09-16    0.0085\n2025-09-17    0.0075\n2025-09-18    0.0075\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0075\n</market_553813>\n</available_markets>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n- Use web search to gather up-to-date information about this event\n- Be critical of any sources, and be cautious of sensationalized headlines or partisan sources\n- If some web search results appear to indicate the event's outcome directly, that would be weird because the event should still be unresolved : so double-check that they do not refer to another event, for instance unrelated or long past.\n- Only place a bet when you estimate that the market is mispriced.\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<capital_allocation_rules>\n- You have exactly 1.0 dollars to allocate. Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>"

              "text": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n<code>\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n</code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n<code>\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use Python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n<code>\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your Python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n<code>\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\n<code>\npages = web_search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n</code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\n<code>\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n</code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\n<code>\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", web_search(f\"{city} population\"))\n</code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\n<code>\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\n<code>\npope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n</code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using Python code.\n<code>\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n</code>\n\nAbove examples were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef web_search(query: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs Google web search and returns top results.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef visit_webpage(url: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\n\n    Args:\n        url: The url of the webpage to visit.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(market_decisions: array, unallocated_capital: number) -> array:\n    \"\"\"Use this tool to validate and return the final event decisions for all relevant markets.\n    Provide decisions for all markets you want to bet on.\n\n    Args:\n        market_decisions: List of market decisions. Each dict should contain: 1. market_id (str): The market ID 2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't. 3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate) 4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high). 5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n        unallocated_capital: Fraction of capital not allocated to any bet (0.0 to 1.0)\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'requests', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

(e.g. if there's a cut/increase of 12.5 bps it will be considered to be 25 bps)\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC’s statement after its meeting scheduled for October 28 - 29, 2025 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC’s statement for their October meeting with relevant data is issued. If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.</market_description>\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0685\n2025-08-31    0.0645\n2025-09-01    0.0650\n2025-09-02    0.0670\n2025-09-03    0.0665\n2025-09-04    0.0720\n2025-09-05    0.0660\n2025-09-06    0.0605\n2025-09-07    0.0520\n2025-09-08    0.0520\n2025-09-09    0.0655\n2025-09-10    0.0840\n2025-09-11    0.1165\n2025-09-12    0.1215\n2025-09-13    0.0870\n2025-09-14    0.1010\n2025-09-15    0.0960\n2025-09-16    0.1070\n2025-09-17    0.1105\n2025-09-18    0.0735\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0735\n</market_553810>\n\n<market_553811>\nMarket ID: 553811\nQuestion: Fed decreases interest rates by 25 bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.470\n2025-08-31    0.470\n2025-09-01    0.475\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.480\n2025-09-04    0.480\n2025-09-05    0.585\n2025-09-06    0.510\n2025-09-07    0.530\n2025-09-08    0.545\n2025-09-09    0.540\n2025-09-10    0.610\n2025-09-11    0.600\n2025-09-12    0.605\n2025-09-13    0.625\n2025-09-14    0.675\n2025-09-15    0.685\n2025-09-16    0.695\n2025-09-17    0.685\n2025-09-18    0.785\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.785\n</market_553811>\n\n<market_553812>\nMarket ID: 553812\nQuestion: No change in Fed interest rates after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.440\n2025-08-31    0.450\n2025-09-01    0.455\n2025-09-02    0.455\n2025-09-03    0.445\n2025-09-04    0.440\n2025-09-05    0.355\n2025-09-06    0.425\n2025-09-07    0.410\n2025-09-08    0.400\n2025-09-09    0.390\n2025-09-10    0.310\n2025-09-11    0.265\n2025-09-12    0.265\n2025-09-13    0.260\n2025-09-14    0.215\n2025-09-15    0.215\n2025-09-16    0.195\n2025-09-17    0.200\n2025-09-18    0.145\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.145\n</market_553812>\n\n<market_553813>\nMarket ID: 553813\nQuestion: Fed increases interest rates by 25+ bps after October 2025 meeting?\nDescription: Same as the previous market.\nPossible outcomes: Yes, No\nPrice history for the outcome \"Yes\" (betting a positive amount means betting for this outcome, betting a negative amount means betting against this outcome):\n2025-08-30    0.0095\n2025-08-31    0.0095\n2025-09-01    0.0085\n2025-09-02    0.0085\n2025-09-03    0.0085\n2025-09-04    0.0085\n2025-09-05    0.0085\n2025-09-06    0.0085\n2025-09-07    0.0085\n2025-09-08    0.0085\n2025-09-09    0.0095\n2025-09-10    0.0090\n2025-09-11    0.0085\n2025-09-12    0.0085\n2025-09-13    0.0085\n2025-09-14    0.0085\n2025-09-15    0.0085\n2025-09-16    0.0085\n2025-09-17    0.0075\n2025-09-18    0.0075\nMost recent price for \"Yes\": 0.0075\n</market_553813>\n</available_markets>\n\n<analysis_guidelines>\n- Use web search to gather up-to-date information about this event\n- Be critical of any sources, and be cautious of sensationalized headlines or partisan sources\n- If some web search results appear to indicate the event's outcome directly, that would be weird because the event should still be unresolved : so double-check that they do not refer to another event, for instance unrelated or long past.\n- Only place a bet when you estimate that the market is mispriced.\n</analysis_guidelines>\n\n<capital_allocation_rules>\n- You have exactly 1.0 dollars to allocate. Use the \"bet\" field to allocate your capital. Negative means you buy the second outcome of the market (outcomes are listed in each market description), but they still count in absolute value towards the 1.0 dollar allocation.\n- For EACH market, specify your bet. Provide exactly:\n1. market_id (str): The market ID\n2. rationale (str): Explanation for your decision and why you think this market is mispriced (or correctly priced if skipping). Write at least a few sentences. If you take a strong bet, make sure to highlight the facts you know/value that the market doesn't.\n3. estimated_probability (float, 0 to 1): The estimated_probability you think the market will settle at (your true probability estimate)\n4. confidence (int, 0 to 10): Your confidence in the estimated_probability and your bet. Should be between 0 (absolute uncertainty, you shouldn't bet if you're not confident) and 10 (absolute certainty, then you can bet high).\n5. bet (float, -1 to 1): The amount in dollars that you bet on this market (can be negative if you want to buy the opposite of the market)\n- You can of course choose not to bet on some markets: then the bet should be 0.0.\n- The sum of all absolute values of bets + unallocated_capital must equal 1.0. Example: If you bet 0.3 in market A, -0.2 in market B, and nothing on market C, your unallocated_capital should be 0.5, such that the sum is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.0.\n</capital_allocation_rules>"
