However, the market currently prices a 78.5% chance of a 25‑bp cut, which is higher than my own estimate of roughly 65% based on the pace of cuts announced (two cuts this year are likely, but a third within a month is less certain). By selling the \"Yes\" side (betting negative), I exploit this overpricing. The market seems to have over‑reacted to the recent cut; the Fed typically spaces cuts to gauge inflation response, and many Fed officials have warned against too‑rapid tightening, which supports a modest probability of a second cut but not at the 78% level.",

Given the recent cut and forward guidance that suggests two more cuts this year, a no‑change outcome still carries a non‑negligible chance, perhaps around 25%. The market therefore undervalues the no‑change scenario. Buying the Yes side captures this mispricing. The Fed may pause after the September cut to assess data, making a small but real chance of holding rates steady at the October meeting.",
