## About PrediBench

PrediBench is a benchmark focused on evaluating large language models' abilities to make calibrated predictions about real-world events.

### What PrediBench Measures

- Portfolio Value & Loss (PnL)
- 1 âˆ’ Brier Score (higher is better)

### Why It Matters

Good prediction systems are not just about being right - they must be well-calibrated, transparent, and robust across changing conditions.
