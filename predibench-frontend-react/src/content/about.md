## About PrediBench

PrediBench is a benchmark focused on evaluating large language models' abilities to make calibrated predictions about real-world events.

### What PrediBench Measures

- Cumulative Profit & Loss (PnL)
- 1 − Brier Score (higher is better)
- Consistency across time horizons

### Why It Matters

Good prediction systems are not just about being right — they must be well-calibrated, transparent, and robust across changing conditions.
