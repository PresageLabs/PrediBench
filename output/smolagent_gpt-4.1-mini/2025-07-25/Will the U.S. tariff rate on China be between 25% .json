{"question": "Will the U.S. tariff rate on China be between 25% and 40% on August 15?", "choice": "no", "messages": [{"task": "Let's say we are the July 25, 2025.\n                Please answer the below question by yes or no. But first, run a detailed analysis. You can search the web for information.\n                One good method for analyzing is to break down the question into sub-parts, like a tree, and assign probabilities to each sub-branch of the tree, to get a total probability of the question being true.\n                Here is the question:\n                Will the U.S. tariff rate on China be between 25% and 40% on August 15?\n                More details:\n                On May 12, 2025, the United States and China announced a 90-day mutual reduction in tariffs as part of a temporary trade de-escalation agreement.\n\nThis market will resolve according to the general tariff rate on imports into the United States from the People's Republic of China on August 15, 2025, 12:00 PM ET. \n\nThe general tariff rate refers to the base tariff rate paid on imports, including any general tariff the U.S. imposes on all imports (e.g. a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 50% tariff on top of that on Chinese imports would equal a 60% tariff).\n\nIf the reported value falls exactly between two brackets, then this market will resolve to the higher range bracket.\n\nItem specific exceptions or increases will not be considered (i.e. this market does not refer to the effective tariff rate). \n\nOnly tariffs which are in effect will qualify. Tariffs which are paused, or which have been announced but not yet gone into effect will not be considered.\n\nThis market's primary resolution source will be official information from the Trump administration, however a consensus of credible information will also be used.\n\n                Here are the latest rates for the 'yes' to that question (rates for 'yes' and 'no' sum to 1), to guide you:\n                2025-07-18    0.635\n2025-07-19    0.670\n2025-07-20    0.680\n2025-07-21    0.680\n2025-07-22    0.675\n2025-07-23    0.700\n2025-07-24    0.725\n2025-07-25    0.745\n\n                Invest in yes only if you think the yes is underrated, and invest in no only if you think that the yes is overrated.\n                What would you decide: buy yes, buy no, or do nothing?\n", "task_images": null, "model_input_messages": "removed"}, {"step_number": 1, "timing": {"start_time": 1755156947.882404, "end_time": 1755156950.840823, "duration": 2.958418846130371}, "model_input_messages": "removed", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_cmgh7eSJdtwZzla2GLgjiWfN", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "web_search", "arguments": {"query": "U.S. tariff rate on China August 2025 latest updates"}}}], "error": null, "model_output_message": {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": {"query": "U.S. tariff rate on China August 2025 latest updates"}, "name": "web_search", "description": null}, "id": "call_cmgh7eSJdtwZzla2GLgjiWfN", "type": "function"}], "raw": {"_type": "ChatCompletion", "id": "chatcmpl-C4MmyACiG96Lga69vBmYF04bR3hjs", "choices": [{"_type": "Choice", "finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"_type": "ChatCompletionMessage", "content": null, "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall", "id": "call_cmgh7eSJdtwZzla2GLgjiWfN", "function": {"_type": "Function", "arguments": {"query": "U.S. tariff rate on China August 2025 latest updates"}, "name": "web_search"}, "type": "function"}]}}], "created": 1755156948, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"_type": "CompletionUsage", "completion_tokens": 26, "prompt_tokens": 1628, "total_tokens": 1654, "completion_tokens_details": {"_type": "CompletionTokensDetails", "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"_type": "PromptTokensDetails", "audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "_request_id": "req_cc5b5fcc5fdc4ed1a0959c6251fd4ee2"}, "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 1628, "output_tokens": 26, "total_tokens": 1654}}, "model_output": null, "code_action": null, "observations": "## Search Results for 'U.S. tariff rate on China August 2025 latest updates'\n0.

Trump Continues Enforcement of Reciprocal Tariffs and Announces New Tariff Rates\n================================================================================================================\n\nThe White House\n\nJuly 7, 2025\n\n**KEEPING AMERICA IN THE DRIVER\u2019S SEAT:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order determining that certain tariff rates, which were initially set to expire on July 9, will expire on August 1, 2025. President Trump also sent tariff letters to many countries informing them of their new reciprocal tariff rates, which will take effect on August 1.\n\n* President Trump took these actions based on information and recommendations from senior officials, including information on the status of trade negotiations.\n  + Since President Trump modified the tariff rates roughly 90 days ago, dozens of countries have agreed or offered to lower their tariff rates and eliminate non-tariff barriers to move toward a more balanced trade relationship with the United States.\n  + Notwithstanding this significant and historic progress, the U.S. trade deficit remains severe.\n  + While the United States is open to additional trade discussions and deals, President Trump is taking action to establish trade relations going forward.\n* President Trump sent letters to many countries explaining that, starting August 1, they will be subject to new reciprocal tariff rates designed to make the terms of our bilateral trade relationships more reciprocal over time and to address the national emergency caused by the massive U.S. goods trade deficit.\n  + In some instances, countries will be subject to a revised reciprocal tariff rate that is lower than the rate initially announced on April 2.\n  + For others, the reciprocal tariff rate may be higher than the previous rate.\n* The President may send more letters in the coming days and weeks. The countries he sent letters to today include:\n  + Japan (25%)\n  + Korea (25%)\n  + South Africa (30%)\n  + Kazakhstan (25%)\n  + Laos (40%)\n  + Malaysia (25%)\n  + Myanmar (40%)\n  + Tunisia (25%)\n  + Bosnia and Herzegovina (30%)\n  + Indonesia (32%)\n  + Bangladesh (35%)\n  + Serbia (35%)\n  + Cambodia (36%)\n  + Thailand (36%)\n\n**TAKING BACK OUR ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY:** Today\u2019s Order, combined with letters sent to trading partners, underscores President Trump\u2019s commitment to take back America\u2019s economic sovereignty by addressing many nonreciprocal trade relationships that threaten our economic and national security.\n\n* President Trump is the best trade negotiator in history. His strategy has focused on addressing systemic imbalances in our tariff rates that have tilted the playing field in favor of our trading partners for decades.\n* Countries that aren\u2019t serious about addressing the tariff and non-tariff trade barriers that impede American exports and harm American workers, farmers, and businesses are facing the consequences.\n* President Trump welcomes the business of our trading partners on American soil: as these countries are aware, there will be no tariff if they decide to build or manufacture products in our country.\n  + President Trump has committed that the United States will do everything possible to get approvals quickly, professionally, and routinely to bring back manufacturing jobs for Americans.\n* President Trump is using tariffs as the necessary and powerful tool to put America First after many years of unsustainable trade deficits that threaten our economy and national security.\n\n**LIBERATING AMERICA FROM UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES:** Since Day One, President Trump challenged the assumption that American workers and businesses must tolerate unfair trade practices that have disadvantaged them for decades and contributed to our historic trade deficit.\n\n* On April 2, President Trump declared a national emergency in response to the large and persistent U.S. goods trade deficit caused by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, unfair tariff and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners\u2019 economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption.\n* President Trump continues to advance the interests of the American people by calling on trading partners to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers and expanding market access for American exporters.\n* Today\u2019s announcement, based on reciprocity and fairness, will help usher in a Golden Age for the American People.\n\n* [News](https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/)\n* [Administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)\n* [Issues](https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/)\n* [Contact](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/)\n* [EOP](https://www.whitehouse.gov/eop/)\n\n* [Visit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/visit/)\n* [Gallery](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gallery/)\n* [Video Library](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/)\n* [America 250](https://www.whitehouse.gov/america250/)\n* [Founding Fathers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/founding-fathers/)\n\n[![](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/themes/whitehouse/assets/img/whitehouse-47-logo.png)](https://www.whitehouse.gov \"The White House\")\n\n### Subscribe to The White House newsletter\n\nPlease leave blank.\n\nText POTUS to 45470 to receive updates\n\nThe White House\n1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW  \nWashington, DC 20500 \n\n* [X](https://x.com/whitehouse)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/whitehouse/)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WhiteHouse/)\n\n[WH.GOV](https://www.whitehouse.gov \"The White House\")\n\n* [Copyright](https://www.whitehouse.gov/copyright/)\n* [Privacy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/privacy/)\n\n[Back to top](#top \"Back to top\")\nUS-China Tariff Rates -

With overlapping measures such as Section 301 tariffs, the recent reciprocal duties, and product-specific controls, understanding what applies in 2025 can be challenging. This article clarifies which US-China tariff rates are currently in effect and how and when they overlap.***\n\n---\n\n***UPDATE (August 12, 2025):*** *President Trump has signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/joint-statement-on-u-s-china-economic-and-trade-meeting-in-stockholm/) extending the current tariff truce with China by another 90 days, moving the expiration date to November 10, 2025. The decision halts a planned escalation of tariffs\u2014now capped at 30 percent on Chinese imports and 10 percent on US goods\u2014in an effort to prevent economic disruption during the critical holiday trade season.*\n\n*Without the extension, US duties on Chinese goods could have jumped to 145 percent, while China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs might have risen to 125 percent, effectively approaching a trade embargo. The move comes as US retailers are stocking up for year-end sales, providing much-needed relief for supply chain planning.*\n\n*Both Washington and Beijing have emphasized the importance of maintaining economic stability and allowing more time for negotiations. Analysts see the extension as laying the groundwork for a potential Trump\u2013Xi summit later this year.*\n\n***UPDATE (August 1, 2025)**: On July 30, 2025, President Donald Trump signed a presidential proclamation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, imposing a [50 percent tariff on a range of semi-finished copper products and copper-intensive derivative goods](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-action-to-address-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-copper/), effective August 1, 2025. Affected imports include copper pipes, wires, rods, sheets, tubes, fittings, cables, connectors, and electrical components. Exempted items include refined copper, ores, concentrates, cathodes, and scrap. According to the White House fact sheet, the tariffs apply only to the copper content of a product; the non-copper portion remains subject to existing duties; the copper tariffs do not stack with other Section 232 tariffs, such as those on automobiles\u2014whichever applies first will prevail; a product inclusion process will be created to allow for additional copper derivatives to be added to the tariff list.*\n\n***UPDATE (June 27, 2025):**Chinese and US officials have confirmed that a deal has been signed between the two countries to uphold the agreements made in the Geneva deal in early May. Speaking to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-26/us-china-have-finalized-tariff-understanding-lutnick-says \"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-26/us-china-have-finalized-tariff-understanding-lutnick-says\"), US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that China would begin to provide rare earths to the US in exchange for the US taking down its countermeasures against China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce later [confirmed](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/syxwfb/art/2025/art_00a79a2980e44ee8b8a2325786979e47.html \"https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/syxwfb/art/2025/art_00a79a2980e44ee8b8a2325786979e47.html\") some of these details, stating that China will \u201capprove the export applications of controlled items that comply with the conditions set out in the law\u201d in exchange for the US lifting a \u201cseries of restrictive measures taken against China\u201d*.\n\n*While specific details of the deal have not yet been released, in the broader context of US-China trade relations, its scope is likely to be limited, focusing on rolling back actions taken since the US imposed \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on China on April 2, rather than tackling long-standing trade disputes. Moreover, China has previously agreed to expediting the processing of export licenses, making it unclear whether any new tangible commitments have been made in the new deal.*\n\n***UPDATE (June 16, 2025):** The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the US Department of Commerce published a [notice](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/06/16/2025-11067/implementation-of-duties-on-steel-pursuant-to-proclamation-10896-adjusting-imports-of-steel-into-the \"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/06/16/2025-11067/implementation-of-duties-on-steel-pursuant-to-proclamation-10896-adjusting-imports-of-steel-into-the\") adding several household appliances to the tariff list of steel-derivative items, meaning they will be subject to an additional 50 percent tariff when imported into the US. The new tariff, which will be levied on the proportion of steel contained in the product rather than the entire item, will come into effect on June 23, 2025. The \u201csteel derivative items\u201d now subject to a 50 percent tariff include combined refrigerator-freezers, dryers, washing machines, dishwashers, and cooking stoves, among other product categories.*\n\n***UPDATE (June 11, 2025):**Following two days of meetings between senior Chinese and US officials in London on June 9 and 10, the two sides have agreed on a framework agreement to uphold the terms of the Geneva trade deal reached in May. Although details of the framework had not been released, Trump told\u00a0[reporters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-china-trade-talks-resume-second-day-2025-06-10/ \"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-china-trade-talks-resume-second-day-2025-06-10/\")\u00a0on Wednesday that \u201cWe made a great deal with China. We\u2019re very happy with it,\u201d adding that \u201cWe have everything we need, and we\u2019re going to do very well with it.\u201d*\n\n*In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that the US is getting \u201ca total of 55% tariffs, China is getting 10%\u201d, suggesting that the current tariff arrangements will remain in place. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed to [reporters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/lutnick-says-us-tariff-levels-china-wont-change-2025-06-11/ \"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/lutnick-says-us-tariff-levels-china-wont-change-2025-06-11/\")\u00a0on Wednesday that the 55 percent tariff rate on China will remain unchanged.*\n\n*The 55 percent tariff consists of the worldwide 10 percent minimum baseline tariff imposed since April 2, 2025, the 20 percent \u201cfentanyl\u201d tariffs imposed since March 4, 2025, and the 25 percent Section 301 tariffs on most Chinese goods in place since Trump\u2019s first term in office.*\n\n---\n\nThe current US-China trade relationship is highly complex, shaped by a tangled web of tariffs that have been imposed, adjusted, revoked, and reinstated going back to 2018. This ongoing situation, which first began under the first Trump administration and has continued throughout the Biden presidency, has escalated significantly since Trump took office again in January 2025.\u00a0\n\nThe complexity arises from multiple overlapping tariffs, including the Section 301 tariffs that seek to tackle what the US deems are China\u2019s unfair trade practices, Section 232 tariffs related to national security concerns (mainly on steel, aluminum, and automobiles), fentanyl-related tariffs addressing illicit drug trade, reciprocal tariffs imposed in response to other countries\u2019 duties, and most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs that apply broadly.\u00a0\n\nRecently, the US and China reached an agreement to lower their reciprocal tariff rates to 10 percent, a major reduction from the previous peak of [145 percent](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/trump-raises-tariffs-on-china-to-145-overview-and-trade-implications/). However, due to other existing duties, the effective tariff rate on most Chinese goods remains above 30 percent. This article breaks down both the history and latest developments of the US\u2019s tariffs on China, and what these tariffs mean today.\u00a0\n\n[DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA\nEXPLORE IN-DEPTH INVESTMENT AND BUSINESS GUIDES.](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/china)\n\nExplore vital economic, geographic, and regulatory insights for business investors, managers, or expats to navigate China\u2019s business landscape.

Many of these tariffs are stacked, meaning multiple duties apply simultaneously on the same goods, significantly increasing the overall cost of imports from China.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the [Peterson Institute for International Economics](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2019/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart) (PIIE), as of May 2025, the US\u2019s average tariff on Chinese goods stands at 51.1 percent, covering all imports. In comparison, China\u2019s average tariff on American goods is 32.6 percent, also applied broadly. PIIE notes that current US tariffs are about 1.5 times higher than when Trump began his second term in January 2025.\u00a0\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **US Tariffs on Chinese Goods (As of August 2025)** | | | | |\n| **Tariff** | **Tariff rate** | **Target products** | **Effective date\\*** | **Stacking** |\n| \u201cLiberation Day\u201d | 34% \u2192 10% (90-day truce + 90-day truce) | All (some exclusions apply) | April 2, 2025 (reduced rate effective May 14, 2025 \u2013 November 10, 2025) | Yes |\n| Fentanyl | 20% | All (some exclusions apply) | March 4, 2025 | Yes |\n| Section 232 | 50% | Steel and aluminum products, steel and aluminum derivative products, automobiles and automotive parts, and some household appliances containing steel and aluminum | June 4, 2025 (June 23 for some household appliances containing steel and aluminum) | Yes, except with reciprocal tariffs |\n| 50% | Semi-finished copper products (such as copper pipes, wires, rods, sheets, and tubes) and copper-intensive derivative products (such as pipe fittings, cables, connectors, and electrical components) | August 1, 2025 | Yes (do not stack with other Section 232 tariffs) |\n| Section 301 | List 1: 25% | List 1: Inorganic chemicals;

These tariffs are imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the US president to impose trade restrictions on goods that \u201cthreaten to impair\u201d US national security.\n\nFind Business Support\n\n[Our team combines local legal and financial expertise to help our clients effectively de-risk their investments.](https://www.dezshira.com/services/legal-financial-due-diligence)\n\n[![]()](https://www.dezshira.com/services/legal-financial-due-diligence)\n\nOn March 18, 2018, the Trump administration imposed a 10 percent tariff on all aluminum imports and a 25 percent tariff on all steel imports to the US. The administration later negotiated exemptions for a range of countries. However, the tariffs on China have remained in place ever since.\u00a0\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Trump signed a [proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/adjusting-imports-of-steel-into-the-united-states/) announcing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on all steel imports into the US and raising tariffs on aluminum imports from 10 to 25 percent. The tariffs are applicable to imports from all countries and regions \u201cwithout exception\u201d, and took effect on March 12.\u00a0\n\nAs the prior steel and aluminum tariffs on China were never lifted, the effective tariff rate on Chinese steel products remained unchanged, while the tariff on aluminum products rose by 15 percentage points. Moreover, many steel and aluminum products coming from China have been separately slapped with a 25 percent duty under the Section 301 action.\u00a0\n\nOn March 26, 2025, Trump [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/adjusting-imports-of-automobiles-and-autombile-parts-into-the-united-states/) a 25 percent tariff on imports of automobiles and automobile parts from all trade partners into the US, effective April 3, 2025. Many vehicles and vehicle parts coming from China were already subject to tariffs of up to 25 percent under the Section 301 tariffs.\n\nOn May 31, 2025, Trump announced he would raise the tariff rate on steel and aluminum imports from all countries to 50 percent from June 4.\n\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), a part of the US Department of Commerce, published a notice on June 16 extending the 50 percent steel and aluminum tariff to several household appliances containing steel, effective June 23. The new tariff, which will be levied on the proportion of steel contained in the product rather than the entire item, will be levied on the following\u00a0\u201csteel derivative items\u201d:\n\n1. Combined refrigerator-freezers (HTSUS: 8418.10.00)\n2. Small and large dryers (HTSUS: 8451.21.00 and 8451.29.00)\n3. Washing machines (HTSUS: 8450.11.00 and 8450.20.00)\n4.

Food waste disposals (HTSUS: 8509.80.20)\n8. Welded wire rack (HTSUS: 9403.99.9020)\n\nWhile the above products will be taxed on their steel content, welded wire rack products will also be taxed on their aluminum content.\n\nOn July 30, 2025, President Donald Trump signed a presidential proclamation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, imposing a [50 percent tariff on a range of semi-finished copper products and copper-intensive derivative goods](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-action-to-address-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-copper/), effective August 1, 2025.\n\n* Affected imports include copper pipes, wires, rods, sheets, tubes, fittings, cables, connectors, and electrical components.\n* Exempted items include refined copper, ores, concentrates, cathodes, and scrap.\n\nAccording to the White House fact sheet:\n\n* The tariffs apply only to the copper content of a product; the non-copper portion remains subject to existing duties.\n* The copper tariffs do not stack with other Section 232 tariffs, such as those on automobiles\u2014whichever applies first will prevail.\n* A product inclusion process will be created to allow for additional copper derivatives to be added to the tariff list.\n\nSection 301 tariffs\n-------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\n* July 6, 2018: 25% tariffs on List 1 goods come into effect.\n* August 23, 2018: 25% tariffs on List 2 goods come into effect.\n* September 24, 2018: 10% tariffs on List 3 goods come into effect.\n* May 10, 2019: List 3 tariffs raised to 25%.\n* September 1, 2019: 15% tariffs on List 4A goods come into effect.\n* December 13, 2019: List 4B tariffs suspended indefinitely.\n* February 14, 2020: List 4A tariffs lowered to 7.5%.\n* September 13, 2024: USTR announces additional tariffs ranging from 25% to 100% following statutory four-year review.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Section 301 tariffs, first imposed in 2018 during Trump\u2019s first term, were, until recently, the most sweeping China-specific tariffs, ultimately affecting goods of US$550 billion in value and setting off the first US-China trade war.\u00a0\n\nThe first Section 301 tariffs came into effect on July 6, 2018, when the US began imposing a 25 percent tariff on 818 imported Chinese products included in List 1, valued at US$34 billion.

This was later increased to 25 percent, effective May 10, 2019, following stalled trade deal talks.\u00a0\n\nOn September 1, 2019, the US began implementing an initial tariff of 15 percent on more than US$125 billion worth of Chinese imports under List 4A, affecting a range of products from footwear, diapers, and food products to smart watches, dishwashers, and flat-panel televisions.\u00a0\n\nList 4 was initially set to cover US$300 billion worth of Chinese goods. However, tariffs on the remaining goods under List 4B, originally set to take effect on December 15, 2019, were suspended, as part of the terms of Phase One of the US-China trade deal. Additionally, the 15 percent rate levied on goods under List 4A was halved to 7.5 percent, effective February 14, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n### Tariff increases following four-year review\n\nOn September 13, 2024, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced [final modifications to the tariff actions under the Section 301 investigation](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2024/september/ustr-finalizes-action-china-tariffs-following-statutory-four-year-review), following a statutory four-year review. The modifications see tariffs ranging from 25 to 100 percent across 14 product groups, primarily in sectors targeted by China for dominance or where the US has recently made significant domestic investments.\u00a0\n\nEffective September 27, tariff rates on the following goods increased:\n\n* Battery parts (non-lithium-ion batteries) \u2013 Increased to 25 percent\n* Electric vehicles \u2013 Increased to 100 percent\n* Facemasks \u2013 Increased to no less than 25 percent\n* Lithium-ion electrical vehicle batteries \u2013 Increased to 25 percent\n* Other critical minerals \u2013 Increased to 25 percent\n* Ship-to-shore cranes \u2013 Increased to 25 percent\n* Solar cells (whether or not assembled into modules) \u2013 Increased to 50 percent\n* Steel and aluminum products \u2013 Increased to 25 percent\n* Syringes and needles \u2013 Increased to no less than 50 percent\n\nMeanwhile, the following tariffs came into effect on January 1, 2025:\u00a0\n\n* Semiconductors \u2013 Increased to 50 percent\n\nFinally, the following tariffs will come into effect on January 1, 2026:\u00a0\n\n* Lithium-ion non-electrical vehicle batteries \u2013 Increased to 25 percent\n* Medical gloves \u2013 Increased to no less than 25 percent\n* Natural graphite \u2013 Increased to 25 percent\n* Permanent magnets \u2013 Increased to 25 percent\n\n### Exemptions\n\nBoth the Trump and Biden administrations issued tariff exclusions for certain products over the years, including broad exemptions during the COVID-19 pandemic for goods deemed essential by the USTR.\u00a0\n\nMany of those exclusions have since expired. However, on May 30, 2024, the USTR extended Section 301 tariff exclusions for 164 Chinese products for one year, through May 31, 2025. It has not indicated whether these will be extended further.\u00a0\n\nFollowing its four-year review, the USTR also granted 14 new exclusions for solar manufacturing equipment, effective retroactively from January 1, 2024, and set to expire on May 31, 2025.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, on October 15, 2024, the USTR launched an electronic portal for requesting tariff exclusions for machinery under HTS headings 84 and 85, covering items like manufacturing equipment and electrical machinery. Companies and trade groups can apply if they demonstrate that the equipment is essential and not reasonably available from domestic sources.\u00a0\n\nFentanyl tariffs\n----------------\n\n\u00a0\n\n* February 4, 2025: 10 percent \u201cfentanyl\u201d tariff on all Chinese goods takes effect.\n* March 4, 2025: Tariff rate raised to 20 percent.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn February 1, 2025, Trump signed an executive order imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese goods entering the country, ostensibly \u201cto take the actions necessary to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels and shut down money laundering by transnational criminal organizations\u201d, per a [White House Fact Sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/).\u00a0\n\nOn March 3, 2025, through another executive order, Trump raised this tariff rate to 20 percent, with the stated reason that China \u201chas not taken adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis through cooperative enforcement actions\u201d. The 20 percent tariff rate took effect on March 4, 2025.\u00a0\n\n### Exemptions\n\nPer an executive order signed on April 29, 2025, addressing the issue of tariff tacking, the following goods will not be subject to the additional 20 percent fentanyl tariffs:\u00a0\n\n* Automobiles and automotive parts subject to Section 232 tariffs\n* Steel and aluminum products subject to Section 232 tariffs\n\nIn addition, articles subject to [50 USC 1702(b)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:50%20section:1702%20edition:prelim)), such as personal transfers of goods without value, donations, information or informational materials, and personal items transported during personal travel, are not subject to the fentanyl tariffs.\u00a0\n\n\u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs\n------------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\n* April 2, 2025: Trump announces a 34% reciprocal tariff on China.\n* April 9, 2025: 34% reciprocal tariff on China takes effect.\n* April 8\u20139, 2025: Trump raises reciprocal tariff on China to 84%, then 125%, effective immediately, following retaliatory action from China.\n* May 14, 2025: Reciprocal tariff on China reduced to 10% for 90 days following agreement.\n* August 12, 2025:\u00a0Reciprocal tariff on China reduced to 10% for another 90 days following agreement.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn April 2, 2025, Trump announced his so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, also known as the \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d, on around 90 trade partners. On China products, he imposed a 34 percent duty to be levied on top of the 20 percent fentanyl tariffs. \u00a0\n\nIn addition to the reciprocal tariff rates on individual countries, Trump also imposed a 10 percent minimum baseline tariff to be levied on all countries.\n\nFind Business Support\n\n[Identify the most competitive country for your next business move with our cross-country competitiveness benchmarking services.](https://www.dezshira.com/landing/cross-country-competitiveness-benchmarking)\n\n[![]()](https://www.dezshira.com/landing/cross-country-competitiveness-benchmarking)\n\nThe universal 10 percent import tariff took effect on April 5, 2025, while the reciprocal tariffs targeting specific countries commenced on April 9, 2025.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFollowing retaliatory tariffs by China on American goods, on April 8, Trump signed an executive order raising the reciprocal tariff from 34 percent to 84 percent, and a day later announced the rate would rise further to 125 percent, bringing the final tariff rate on China to 145 percent, effective immediately.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn Monday, May 12, 2025, following a meeting between Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, the US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer, in Geneva, China and the US agreed to lower reciprocal tariff rates from 125 percent [to just 10 percent for a period of 90 days](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/us-china-tariffs-lowered-to-10-percent-90-days/). The existing 20 percent fentanyl tariff on Chinese goods will remain in place, meaning the final tariff rate on Chinese goods will be 30 percent.\u00a0\n\nUnder the agreement, both sides committed to entirely cancel the higher reciprocal tariff rates imposed in succession from April 9, while the 34 percent rate initially imposed by the US on April 2 was amended to 10 percent for an initial period of 90 days. This means that, should no further deal be reached in the next 90 days and this period is not extended, the tariff rate will return to 34 percent, not 125 percent.\u00a0\n\nOn August 11, 2025, President Trump signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/joint-statement-on-u-s-china-economic-and-trade-meeting-in-stockholm/) extending the current tariff truce with China by another 90 days, moving the expiration date to November 10, 2025. The decision halts a planned escalation of tariffs\u2014now capped at 30 percent on Chinese imports and 10 percent on US goods\u2014in an effort to prevent economic disruption during the critical holiday trade season.\n\nWithout the extension, US duties on Chinese goods could have jumped to 145 percent, while China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs might have risen to 125 percent, effectively approaching a trade embargo. The move comes as US retailers are stocking up for year-end sales, providing much-needed relief for supply chain planning.\n\nBoth Washington and Beijing have emphasized the importance of maintaining economic stability and allowing more time for negotiations. Analysts see the extension as laying the groundwork for a potential Trump\u2013Xi summit later this year.\n\n### Exemptions\n\nIn an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/clarification-of-exceptions-under-executive-order-14257-of-april-2-2025-as-amended/) signed on April 11, 2025, Trump exempted a range of electronic products and components from the reciprocal tariffs, including computers (including parts and accessories for their assembly), smartphones, flat panel displays, SSDs, computer monitors, various types of semiconductors, and integrated circuits. The exemptions are effective retroactively from April 5.\u00a0\n\nTrump has warned that the exemption will not be permanent, stating that semiconductors and the electronics supply chain will be looked at in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u00a0\n\nThe 20 percent fentanyl tariffs still apply to these exempted goods.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the following goods are not subject to the reciprocal tariffs:\u00a0\n\n* Articles subject to [50 USC 1702(b)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:50%20section:1702%20edition:prelim)), such as personal transfers of goods without value, donations, information or informational materials, and personal items transported during personal travel;\n* Steel and aluminum articles and autos/auto parts that are already subject to the 25 percent Section 232 tariffs;\n* Copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber articles;\n* All articles that may become subject to future Section 232 tariffs;\n* Bullion; and\n* Energy and certain other minerals that are not available in the US.\n\nChina\u2019s counter-tariffs on American goods\u00a0\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **China\u2019s Tariffs on US Goods (June 2025)** | | | | |\n| **Tariff Category** | **Tariff Rate** | **Target Products** | **Effective Date** | **Stacking** |\n| Section 232 retaliatory tariffs | 15%\u201325% | US steel, aluminum, and other metals | April 2, 2018 | Yes |\n| Section 301 retaliatory tariffs | 2.5%\u201325% | Soybeans, LNG, autos, chemicals, electronics, and more | July 2018\u2013Feb 2020 | Yes |\n| Anti-dumping duties (POM Copolymers) | 74.9% | Engineering plastics used in auto parts and medical devices | May 18, 2025 | No |\n| \u201cLiberation Day\u201d retaliatory tariffs | 34% \u2192 10% (90-day truce) | All US goods | April 2, 2025 \u2192 May 14, 2025 | Yes |\n| Fentanyl retaliatory tariffs | 10%\u201315% | Coal, LNG, crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-engine vehicles; chicken, wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, dairy | Feb\u2013March 2025 | Yes |\n| Most-favored-nation | Approx. 7% | All imports (baseline rate under WTO rules) | Ongoing | Yes |\n\n### Retaliatory action against Section 301 tariffs\n\n* April 2, 2018: Tariffs of 15% to 25% on 128 US products in retaliation for Section 232 tariffs.\n* July 6, 2018: 25% tariffs on US$34 billion worth of US goods in retaliation for List 1 tariffs.\n* August 23, 2018: 25% tariffs on US$16 billion of US goods in retaliation for List 1 tariffs.\n* September 24, 2018: 10% tariffs on US$60 billion of US goods in retaliation for List 3 tariffs.\n* June 1, 2019: Tariffs on US$60 billion in US goods raised to up to 25%.\n* September 1, 2019: Tariffs of 5% to 10% on US$75 billion in US goods in retaliation for List 4 tariffs.\n* February 6, 2020: Tariffs on some US goods halved to 5% and 2.5% under the Phase One trade deal, effective February 14.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChina began its tariff retaliation on April 2, 2018, following the US\u2019s Section 301 tariffs.

These included soybeans, automobiles, seafood, and other commodities.\u00a0\n\nIn response to the US introducing a second batch of 25 percent tariffs on US$16 billion worth of Chinese goods (List 2) on August 23, 2018, China imposed a similar 25 percent tariff on 333 US products, which covered chemicals, medical devices, and petroleum-based products.\u00a0\n\nFollowing the List 3 tariffs imposed on September 24, 2018, China responded by imposing a 10 percent tariff on about US$60 billion of US goods. This wide-ranging list targeted thousands of products, including meat, LNG, and chemical goods.\u00a0\n\nIn June 2019, after the US raised List 3 tariffs to 25 percent, China increased its retaliatory tariffs on US$60 billion in US goods, with rates ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent. \u00a0\n\nOn September 1, 2019, China retaliated against new US tariffs (List 4A) by imposing additional 5 percent tariffs on US$75 billion of US exports. These included crude oil, aircraft parts, soybeans, and cars, expanding the scope of the trade conflict to cover nearly all US-China trade.\u00a0\n\nIn January 2020, as part of the Phase One trade deal, China\u2019s Finance Ministry announced that it would halve tariffs on 1,717 US goods, lowering the tariff on some items from 10 percent to 5 percent, and others from 5 percent to 2.5 percent, effective February 14, 2020.\u00a0\n\n### Exemptions\n\nSince 2019, China has granted exemptions to the retaliatory tariffs for certain American goods. The first two tariff exemption lists were released in September 2019, exempting 16 products in total, including many agricultural and fishery goods, such as shrimp and prawn seedlings, alfalfa meal, and whey for fodder. A further six products were added to this first batch of exemptions in December 2019.\u00a0\n\nIn February 2020, China released a second batch of exemptions under two more lists covering 65 products, including timber, presswork, hydraulic motor, diaphragm pump, aircraft parts, and medical equipment like non-invasive ventilators and temperature sensors.\u00a0\n\nIn the years since, China has continued to grant extensions to these exemption lists, usually one year in length. However, the [last extension](https://gss.mof.gov.cn/gzdt/zhengcefabu/202411/t20241129_3948530.htm), granted in November 2024, expired on February 28, 2025, and has not been extended again, meaning all exemptions have now expired.
