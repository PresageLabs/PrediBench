In the race for president, if no candidate secures more than 50% of the vote or a 10-percentage-point advantage over the rest of the field, the two leading contenders will head to a runoff scheduled for October 19. The presidential and legislative winners will all take office on November 8.\n\nThe country\u2019s deep [economic crisis](https://americasquarterly.org/article/escape-economic-crisis-bolivia/) is top-of-mind for voters as inflation, fuel shortages, and a lack of formal employment opportunities continue to weigh on the public. President Luis Arce has [opted](https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-elections-morales-arce-race-campaign-polls-leftwing-9296923408ddcfa429aff4cf9e3e7626) not to run for reelection, and a Constitutional Court ruling in May [barred](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bolivia-top-court-upholds-ruling-blocking-morales-election-eligibility-2025-05-14/) former President Evo Morales from participating.\n\nThe candidates polling over 10% in a July [Ipsos Ciesmori](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/07/14/mas-incertidumbre-electoral-en-bolivia-por-nueva-encuesta-en-la-que-sube-el-voto-blanco-nulo-e-indeciso/) survey are included below in alphabetical order by last name. *AQ*\u202fasked a dozen nonpartisan experts on Bolivia to help us identify where each candidate stands on two spectrums: left versus right on economic matters, and personalistic versus institutionalist on leadership style.

He has led other large [companies](https://www.noticiasfides.com/nacional/politica/doria-medina-a-garcia-linera-no-conozco-a-gustavo-vedia-y-no-soy-dueno-de-subway--365669-365580) and built Bolivia\u2019s [tallest skyscraper](https://greentower.com.bo/la-paz). A longtime centrist and social democrat, he was minister of planning (1991-93) in the administration of President Jaime Paz Zamora. In the 2020 election, he was incumbent President Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s [running mate](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2020/02/02/jeanine-anez-eligio-a-samuel-doria-medina-como-companero-de-formula-para-las-elecciones-en-bolivia/) before they [dropped out](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-54200128) of the race amid poor polling. He is now at the head of the largest opposition [coalition](https://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/samuel-doria-medina-inscribe-alianza-234750859.html), Unidad, which includes prominent groups like Creemos, backed by Luis Fernando Camacho, and Comunidad Ciudadana, led by former President Carlos Mesa.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT WIN**\n\nGiven President Arce\u2019s [lack of popular support](https://x.com/cidgallup/status/1889078200346583506/photo/1), the [rifts within the ruling MAS party](https://americasquarterly.org/article/bolivia-enters-contentious-new-political-landscape/), and the country\u2019s [economic straits](https://americasquarterly.org/article/escape-economic-crisis-bolivia/), many voters appear ready to support a moderate opposition candidate. As a centrist, Doria Medina may attract former MAS supporters who are looking for an alternative outside of the conservative right. His [background in business](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/06/29/samuel-doria-medina-candidato-a-presidente-de-bolivia-en-los-ultimos-20-anos-el-gobierno-ha-cohabitado-con-el-narcotrafico/) allows him to maintain that he is a political outsider, and his track record of entrepreneurial success lends credibility to his claims that he can fix the economy. He has shown with Unidad that he can lead a coalition, and recently won the backing of [Marcelo Claure](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-18/bolivia-s-richest-man-backs-a-millionaire-candidate-in-bid-to-oust-the-left?sref=5LmjrEiv), Bolivia\u2019s richest man.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT LOSE**\n\nSome voters might prefer other moderate candidates with more government experience. Doria Medina\u2019s reputation as a perennial presidential candidate may be detrimental to his outsider image. He could also be overtaken by candidates further to the right, who have adopted a less conciliatory and more aggressive stance toward the MAS and the status quo.\n\n#### **WHO SUPPORTS HIM**\n\nHe has broad name recognition and appears to be drawing support from both longtime moderate MAS opponents and voters who have more recently soured on the ruling party. His supporters tend to believe that he is the opposition candidate most likely to unite enough of the country behind him to win. Doria Medina\u2019s strongest support comes from the middle classes, with the poorest individuals tending to lean toward leftist candidates and the richest tending to lean further to the right. As the candidate of the broadest opposition coalition, he has won endorsements from [public intellectuals](https://eldeber.com.bo/pais/vicente-cuellar-renuncia-su-candidatura-y-mantiene-su-apoyo-samuel_514268/) and business leaders alike.\n\n#### **WHAT HE WOULD DO**\n\nLike all leading candidates, he plans to [reduce](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/06/29/samuel-doria-medina-candidato-a-presidente-de-bolivia-en-los-ultimos-20-anos-el-gobierno-ha-cohabitado-con-el-narcotrafico/) fuel and other subsidies to cut government spending. Doria Medina emphasizes [transparency](https://www.noticiasfides.com/nacional/politica/doria-medina-ve-prioritario-que-el-gobierno-trabaje-en-recuperar-la-credibilidad-del-censo-418614), incentives for small businesses, and reductions in taxes and red tape for the private sector. He favors [shutting down](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/06/29/samuel-doria-medina-candidato-a-presidente-de-bolivia-en-los-ultimos-20-anos-el-gobierno-ha-cohabitado-con-el-narcotrafico/) certain state-owned businesses and [deals](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-UNIDAD.pdf) with the IMF and other multilateral organizations to liberalize the economy more broadly, while also supporting certain poverty-reduction spending. His party [platform](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-UNIDAD.pdf) vows not to cut cash transfer programs.\n\n#### IDEOLOGY\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IdeologyBOLIVIA_0709252-scaled.jpg)\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cand_Bolivia_Rodiriguez.jpg)\n\nAndr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez\n-------------------\n\n### 36, Senate president\n\n#### Alianza Popular\n\n##### \u201cI want to promote a new way of doing politics in which dialogue, compromise and social peace come first.\u201d\n\n#### **HOW HE GOT HERE**\n\nAndr\u00f3nico, as he is popularly known, has been a [longtime MAS member](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/articles/cy8d709nejno) and president of the Senate since 2020, when he first won public office. He hails from Cochabamba, the cocalero organizing stronghold where his father was a Quechua campesino leader and his mother worked for a union. After studying political science, Rodr\u00edguez [worked his way](https://www.latercera.com/mundo/noticia/andy-joven-protegido-evo-morales-aspira-convertirse-sucesor/867443/) up the ranks of Bolivia\u2019s biggest coca growers\u2019 association, eventually replacing Evo Morales as its president in 2019. In this organization, he was Morales\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and close confidant, remaining as the federation\u2019s leader during his presidency (2006-19). He [agreed](https://www.diario-red.com/articulo/america-latina/alianza-popular-bolivia-confirma-andronico-rodriguez-como-candidato-presidencial/20250519120000047676.html) to run for president with the leftist Alianza Popular coalition in May.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT WIN**\n\nGrassroots movements that support the MAS could largely back Rodr\u00edguez. Other MAS-affiliated candidates are [polling](https://elpais.bo/nacional/20250601_samuel-y-tuto-lideran-la-primera-encuesta-nacional-de-candidatos-inscritos-a-las-elecciones-2025.html?__cf_chl_tk=P4RQpjj6ZfCEY0m5pGWh56NaqEfQDK3T07yVZFR1WQU-1752007354-1.0.1.1-qbLlGO8xZIjGLR0iSGJazOCf85LEntT1lo4m0Vfs9Gg#google_vignette) in the single digits, and Rodr\u00edguez may be able to attract MAS supporters while also appealing to other voters as a fresh face less associated with the establishment. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s closer alignment with the Morales wing of the MAS over Arce\u2019s also distances him somewhat from the unpopular incumbent. For now, Morales continues to [criticize](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/evo-arremete-contra-andronico-y-lo-acusa-de-representar-intereses-de-la-derecha-2025713125143) Rodr\u00edguez and withhold his support, as Rodr\u00edguez insists that he should be allowed to run for president.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT LOSE**\n\nDue to his association with the MAS, Rodr\u00edguez may fall victim to the general anti-incumbent mood amid the country\u2019s economic decline under Arce\u2019s government. Some Morales supporters may refuse to vote for him, and other MAS voters may align with other candidates. Recent [protests](https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-evo-morales-protestas-elecciones-candidatura-inhabilitacion-a1e0e3fa8eaeac5c303e6e950d3ef5ea) in support of Morales\u2019 attempt to run for president have in some cases turned violent. Rodr\u00edguez lacks executive experience in government and has thus far appeared only [sparingly](https://www.vision360.bo/noticias/2025/07/15/28445-andronico-elude-nuevamente-un-foro-electoral-con-el-mismo-argumento-razones-de-agenda) in the media and candidate [forums](https://www.vision360.bo/noticias/2025/07/15/28445-andronico-elude-nuevamente-un-foro-electoral-con-el-mismo-argumento-razones-de-agenda).\n\n#### **WHO SUPPORTS HIM**\n\nRodr\u00edguez has support from the major campesino organizing fronts he has interacted with throughout his career. He is likely to draw votes from rural Bolivians who are often undercounted in the polls. As the youngest candidate, he may also appeal to voters who seek an alternative to established political figures.\n\n#### **WHAT HE WOULD DO**\n\nRodr\u00edguez has said he would gradually [reduce](https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/pais/andronico-habla-responde-evo-combustibles-plan-gobierno-entrevista/20250707005356975909.html) fuel and other subsidies, in line with his Alianza Popular party\u2019s \u201c[intelligent austerity](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-POPULAR.pdf)\u201d proposals, and try to reduce government spending by prioritizing the most disadvantaged sectors while cutting down on bureaucracy, redundancy, and waste. To inject dollars into the economy, he [has said](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/como-traera-andronico-rodriguez-dolares-para-bolivia-conoce-su-propuesta-economica-20257219945) he favors seeking loans from groups like BRICS over traditional lenders like the IMF. He also aims to boost exports by offering incentives to the private sector, but would also maintain strong government involvement in key areas like mining and tourism, as well as [push](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-POPULAR.pdf) import substitution through tariffs on certain sectors.\n\n#### IDEOLOGY\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IdeologyBOLIVIA_070925-scaled.jpg)\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cand_Bolivia_Quiroga.jpg)\n\nJorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga\n--------------------\n\n### 65, former president\n\n#### Alianza Libre\n\n##### \u201cThe first thing I will do when I get to the Palace of Government is return stability to the country.\u201d\n\n#### **HOW HE GOT HERE**\n\n[\u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga](https://clubmadrid.org/who/members/quiroga-jorge-fernando/) served as president from 2001-2, and has run for president three times before, most recently in 2020, [dropping out](https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/pais/20201011/semana-elecciones-tuto-quiroga-declina-su-candidatura-presidencia) before the election amid poor polling. He was finance minister under Zamora for eight months in 1992, and five years later, he became the country\u2019s youngest-ever vice president in the administration of President [Hugo B\u00e1nzer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugo-Banzer-Suarez). B\u00e1nzer was a controversial figure who had been a [right-wing military dictator](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugo-Banzer-Suarez) from 1971, when he led a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, until he was deposed in 1978. In 2001, B\u00e1nzer resigned due to ill health, and Quiroga completed B\u00e1nzer\u2019s term but opted not to run for reelection. He has worked for major Bolivian mining and banking firms as well as the IMF and the World Bank. He is running with the Libre coalition after [leaving](https://eldeber.com.bo/pais/tras-ruptura-del-bloque-de-unidad-tuto-afirma-que-esta-condenado-entenderse-con-samuel_510027/) a broader opposition group that largely opted to support Doria Medina.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT WIN**\n\nQuiroga is the main standard-bearer for Bolivia\u2019s right wing in this election, and he has long warned that the MAS\u2019 economic populism would lead to the kind of fiscal and economic crunch that has come to pass. He may be able to capitalize on widespread discontent with how Arce and the MAS have handled the economy by offering the sharpest contrast to the ruling party among all leading candidates.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT LOSE**\n\nQuiroga didn\u2019t gain traction when he ran for president in 2020 and may struggle to attract moderates, limiting his appeal beyond his conservative base. His close association with B\u00e1nzer and the unpopular record of B\u00e1nzer\u2019s presidency could alienate some voters.\n\n#### **WHO SUPPORTS HIM**\n\nAs a long-standing and vocal critic of the MAS, Quiroga is popular among the country\u2019s most conservative voters and many of those disillusioned by the Arce government. He appeals to voters who roundly reject the MAS and its economic project, and who seek a return to pre-2005 Bolivia. Quiroga has strong support among the upper classes, especially in La Paz, and major players in the private sector.\n\n#### **WHAT HE WOULD DO**\n\nQuiroga would aim to dramatically shrink the government\u2019s role in the economy and its spending. He [advocates](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-LIBERTAD-Y-DEMOCRACIA.pdf) an IMF rescue package and favors stricter austerity measures than other candidates. Quiroga has also spoken of digitalizing government to make it more efficient and transparent, and said he would give every adult in the country a [\u201cpopular property title\u201d](https://elperiodico.com.bo/tuto-quiroga-intensifica-campana-con-su-oferta-de-titulo-de-propiedad-popular-por-us-1-500/) worth $1,500, as a symbolic share of the country\u2019s natural resources that can be used to access loans.\n\n#### IDEOLOGY\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IdeologyBOLIVIA_0709253-scaled.jpg)\n\n#### ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RB-Headshot-e1704321264443.jpg)\n\n##### Rich Brown\n\nReading Time:   < 1 minute*Brown is an editor and production manager at Americas Quarterly.*\n\n**Follow Rich Brown:**\u00a0\u00a0 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-brown-62b3a118a/)\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/@richmattbrown)\n\n[![Demonstrators during a drivers' union protest against fuel shortages in La Paz in June.June 4, 2025.

Manuel Seoane/Bloomberg via Getty Images \n\nReading Time:   4 minutes\n\nLA PAZ\u2014Bolivia is heading into uncharted territory as the August 17 elections near. For the first time in two decades, former President Evo Morales, the leader of the [once-dominant](https://americasquarterly.org/article/bolivia-enters-contentious-new-political-landscape/) Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) will not appear anywhere on the ballot. Meanwhile, the public is preparing to vote with [inflation](https://tradingeconomics.com/bolivia/inflation-cpi) at 24%, its highest level in over three decades, making the presidential race an unpredictable test for the political system and its institutions.\n\nFor Bolivians, it is a wholly new experience to see [polls indicating](https://brujuladigital.net/politica/2025/06/18/samuel-lidera-encuesta-de-el-deber-con-24-de-intencion-de-voto-jorge-tuto-quiroga-le-sigue-con-22-47660) that two right-wing opposition leaders, most likely Samuel Doria Medina and Jorge Quiroga, could advance to a runoff on October 19. The reason, polling suggests, is that economic concerns now [outweigh](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/encuesta-nacional-que-dicen-los-bolivianos-sobre-la-economia-del-pais-y-de-sus-familias--2025327202231) political ones for most Bolivians amid a [crisis](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/bolivias-economy-on-the-brink/) marked by a shortage of U.S. dollars, scarce fuel, and rising inflation. In the country\u2019s highly polarized environment, [protests](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/bolivia-inflation-soars-to-34-year-high-ahead-of-august-election) occur almost daily, and highway blockades in the countryside are exacerbating the shortages.\n\nNo matter who wins, the next president will have to implement painful reforms. These include reducing a fiscal deficit that has hovered around 10% for years, possibly tripling domestic fuel prices, and negotiating with international lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund, to secure the dollars needed to stabilize the economy and the nation\u2019s foreign trade.\n\nIn a report on May 30, the IMF [recommended](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2025/05/30/pr-25168-bolivia-imf-concludes-2025-art-iv-consult) that Bolivia adopt \u201ca credible and sustained fiscal consolidation\u201d to rationalize the nation\u2019s wages, phase out fuel subsidies, enhance public investment and spending efficiency, and boost tax revenue. \u201cEliminating monetary financing of fiscal deficits is also important,\u201d the multilateral lender stated, noting that the country\u2019s central bank has financed the deficit despite tight external conditions and the fact that public debt has increased to 95% of GDP.\n\nPresident Luis Arce, who has opted not to seek reelection due to his low approval ratings, continues to defend his administration. Earlier this week, he [blamed](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/07/22/luis-arce-justifica-la-crisis-economica-de-bolivia-los-culpables-estan-sentados-en-la-asamblea) national lawmakers for failing to pass key bills that would authorize external funding. \u201cWhen there are economic problems, they point to the government as if we were the culprits,\u201d Arce said Arce said at a public event in La Paz. \u201cThe culprits are sitting in the Legislative Assembly, because they don\u2019t approve loans, because they want to make us look bad in front of the people by saying we don\u2019t know how to do anything.\u201d According to Arce\u2019s Planning Ministry, the legislative branch has 17 bills under review that are expected to trigger $1.7 billion in investments.\n\n**A cascading dollar crisis**\n\nAt the turn of the century and during its first decade, high commodity prices lifted many economies in Latin America, and Bolivia became the [second-largest beneficiary](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/bolivias-economy-on-the-brink) of the boom, behind only Venezuela. By 2014, Bolivia had accumulated nearly [$14 billion](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/bolivias-economy-on-the-brink/) in foreign reserves, largely thanks to gas exports. However, the country failed to encourage enough exploration, and government gas revenue plummeted from $5.5 billion a decade ago to under $1.6 billion last year.\n\nThe government, nevertheless, has maintained expensive subsidies and propped up a [fixed exchange rate](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/bolivias-economy-on-the-brink/), and the country now likely has well under $2 billion in reserves. Most of that is gold, and the central bank may hold less than [$50 million](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-bolivia-to-ccc-24-01-2025) in hard foreign currency reserves, Fitch Ratings said when it downgraded the nation\u2019s credit rating to CCC- in January.\n\nFuel subsidies have been a major source of spending, amounting to [nearly $3 billion](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2024/11/25/presupuesto-de-bolivia-en-2025-preve-continuar-con-la-subvencion-de-combustibles-se-destinaran-56-millones-de-dolares-a-la-semana/) annually. Now, due to the fiscal crunch, the government imports less, resulting in common shortages. Long lines have formed at gas stations across the country, where truck and car drivers sometimes wait days to fill their tanks.\n\nAll major presidential hopefuls, even the leading MAS-aligned candidate, Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, agree that fuel subsidies will need to be cut\u2014the only questions are how much, how fast, and how intensely the public will protest. Fuel prices could triple without subsidies. When the agribusiness group [Anapo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/anapobolivia) announced a month ago that it had begun [importing fuel](https://brujuladigital.net/economia/2025/06/11/anapo-importa-su-propio-diesel-a-bs-135-el-litro-47359) from Brazil, it said it was paying more than three times the domestic selling price.\n\nMeanwhile, the process of attracting new investment in the gas sector could take years. It would likely require broad political consensus on the need for significant reform to cut taxes on the gas industry and otherwise incentivize private sector participation. Even then, the government would also need to work to convince investors that Bolivia is overall a credible investment destination.\n\n**Addressing the shortage**\n\nThe shortage of U.S. dollars has hit imports across the board, worsening inflation for basic goods, including medicines. The fixed exchange rate maintained by the Arce administration has become untenable. For the first time in 40 years, a black-market dollar rate has emerged. For now, the dollar gets around [14 bolivianos](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/a-cuanto-se-cotiza-el-dolar-paralelo-en-bolivia-este-domingo-20-de-julio-vuelve-a-bajar-202572073947) on the black market compared to just 6.96 bolivianos through official channels.\n\nDollar shortages have become so severe that a banking \u201c*corralito*\u201d has taken hold: Depositors are unable to withdraw dollars from their accounts and are instead given bolivianos at the official rate. Devaluation is already a reality on the street, and a painful official devaluation seems all but inevitable.\n\nArce has been unable to attract dollars to right the ship. His efforts to approve lithium contracts that promise [$1.4 billion](https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-russian-firms-to-build-lithium-plants-in-bolivia/7160921.html) in investment from a Chinese and a Russian company, for example, have stalled in the Legislative Assembly, due largely to the ruling party\u2019s internal divisions. The situation is no better in the broader mining sector; gold exports generate minimal revenue for the state, and the [Mut\u00fan iron plant](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/bolivia-set-start-up-china-funded-steel-plant-2025-02-13/) has only just begun operations.\n\nThe major candidates all agree that to bolster the supply of dollars the country will need to secure major loans. Opposition candidates are focused on the IMF and similar multilateral lenders, while Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, the leading MAS-affiliated leftist candidate, [leans instead](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/como-traera-andronico-rodriguez-dolares-para-bolivia-conoce-su-propuesta-economica-20257219945) toward options like BRICS.\n\nAny deal will require tradeoffs. Traditional multilateral loans will demand significant spending cuts as well as measures to improve transparency in public finances*.* It may also be necessary to shut down loss-making state-owned enterprises and lay off a number of public employees, for example.\n\nThese challenges await whoever becomes the next president. If an opposition candidate wins and the right returns to power after two decades in the wilderness, painful rationalization measures will threaten the administration\u2019s stability. If the leftist Rodr\u00edguez prevails, he may well also face a hostile majority in the new legislature. The road out of Bolivia\u2019s economic crisis will be a hard one for whatever government takes shape.\n\n#### ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Penaranda.jpeg)\n\n##### Ra\u00fal Pe\u00f1aranda U.\n\nReading Time:   4 minutes*Pe\u00f1aranda U. is a Bolivian journalist and director of the Br\u00fajula Digital news portal.
