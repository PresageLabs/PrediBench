Still, 15.5% of voters remain undecided, adding uncertainty to the final outcome.\n\n\"Although a poll is a snapshot of the moment and will shift over time, the trends are clear,\" political analyst Jos\u00e9 Luis Santistevan said.\n\n### Related\n\n* [Bolivia's presidential election faces growing uncertainty](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2025/06/18/Bolivia-election-tensions-intensify/8301750264484/ \"Bolivia's presidential election faces growing uncertainty\")\n* [Bolivian ex-president says his car was fired on during assassination attempt](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2024/10/27/bolivia-ex-president-morales-shooting/8751730044066/ \"Bolivian ex-president says his car was fired on during assassination attempt\")\n\nHe said voters appear to be turning away from the ruling party amid a worsening economic crisis that has affected jobs, food access and household income across Bolivia.\n\nBolivia is in the midst of a severe economic crisis, driven by rising prices for basic goods, fuel shortages and a lack of foreign currency. The crisis has intensified social tensions nationwide.\n\nInfighting on the left has weakened the ruling party's standing. Former President [Evo Morales](https://www.upi.com/topic/Evo_Morales/ \"Evo Morales\"), current President Luis Arce and President of the Senate Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez have publicly clashed, eroding support for the political movement that has governed Bolivia since Morales first won the presidency in 2005 with 53.7% of the vote.\n\nThe latest polling suggests no candidate is likely to win outright in the first round on Aug. 17, political analyst Reymi Ferreira said. He added that Doria Medina and Quiroga are likely to face each other in a runoff Oct. 20.\n\nSince the Constitutional Court disqualified former President Evo Morales from running -- citing constitutional term limits -- his supporters have launched blockades and protests across several regions, threatening national stability and the election itself.\n\nDespite the unrest, the vote remains scheduled for August 17, with an estimated 7.5 million Bolivians expected to go to the polls.\n\n* Topics\n* [Politics](https://www.upi.com/topic/Politics/)\n* [Evo

A longtime centrist and social democrat, he was minister of planning (1991-93) in the administration of President Jaime Paz Zamora.

He is now at the head of the largest opposition [coalition](https://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/samuel-doria-medina-inscribe-alianza-234750859.html), Unidad, which includes prominent groups like Creemos, backed by Luis Fernando Camacho, and Comunidad Ciudadana, led by former President Carlos Mesa.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT WIN**\n\nGiven President Arce\u2019s [lack of popular support](https://x.com/cidgallup/status/1889078200346583506/photo/1), the [rifts within the ruling MAS party](https://americasquarterly.org/article/bolivia-enters-contentious-new-political-landscape/), and the country\u2019s [economic straits](https://americasquarterly.org/article/escape-economic-crisis-bolivia/), many voters appear ready to support a moderate opposition candidate. As a centrist, Doria Medina may attract former MAS supporters who are looking for an alternative outside of the conservative right. His [background in business](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/06/29/samuel-doria-medina-candidato-a-presidente-de-bolivia-en-los-ultimos-20-anos-el-gobierno-ha-cohabitado-con-el-narcotrafico/) allows him to maintain that he is a political outsider, and his track record of entrepreneurial success lends credibility to his claims that he can fix the economy. He has shown with Unidad that he can lead a coalition, and recently won the backing of [Marcelo Claure](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-18/bolivia-s-richest-man-backs-a-millionaire-candidate-in-bid-to-oust-the-left?sref=5LmjrEiv), Bolivia\u2019s richest man.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT LOSE**\n\nSome voters might prefer other moderate candidates with more government experience. Doria Medina\u2019s reputation as a perennial presidential candidate may be detrimental to his outsider image. He could also be overtaken by candidates further to the right, who have adopted a less conciliatory and more aggressive stance toward the MAS and the status quo.\n\n#### **WHO SUPPORTS HIM**\n\nHe has broad name recognition and appears to be drawing support from both longtime moderate MAS opponents and voters who have more recently soured on the ruling party. His supporters tend to believe that he is the opposition candidate most likely to unite enough of the country behind him to win. Doria Medina\u2019s strongest support comes from the middle classes, with the poorest individuals tending to lean toward leftist candidates and the richest tending to lean further to the right. As the candidate of the broadest opposition coalition, he has won endorsements from [public intellectuals](https://eldeber.com.bo/pais/vicente-cuellar-renuncia-su-candidatura-y-mantiene-su-apoyo-samuel_514268/) and business leaders alike.\n\n#### **WHAT HE WOULD DO**\n\nLike all leading candidates, he plans to [reduce](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/06/29/samuel-doria-medina-candidato-a-presidente-de-bolivia-en-los-ultimos-20-anos-el-gobierno-ha-cohabitado-con-el-narcotrafico/) fuel and other subsidies to cut government spending. Doria Medina emphasizes [transparency](https://www.noticiasfides.com/nacional/politica/doria-medina-ve-prioritario-que-el-gobierno-trabaje-en-recuperar-la-credibilidad-del-censo-418614), incentives for small businesses, and reductions in taxes and red tape for the private sector. He favors [shutting down](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/06/29/samuel-doria-medina-candidato-a-presidente-de-bolivia-en-los-ultimos-20-anos-el-gobierno-ha-cohabitado-con-el-narcotrafico/) certain state-owned businesses and [deals](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-UNIDAD.pdf) with the IMF and other multilateral organizations to liberalize the economy more broadly, while also supporting certain poverty-reduction spending. His party [platform](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-UNIDAD.pdf) vows not to cut cash transfer programs.\n\n#### IDEOLOGY\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IdeologyBOLIVIA_0709252-scaled.jpg)\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cand_Bolivia_Rodiriguez.jpg)\n\nAndr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez\n-------------------\n\n### 36, Senate president\n\n#### Alianza Popular\n\n##### \u201cI want to promote a new way of doing politics in which dialogue, compromise and social peace come first.\u201d\n\n#### **HOW HE GOT HERE**\n\nAndr\u00f3nico, as he is popularly known, has been a [longtime MAS member](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/articles/cy8d709nejno) and president of the Senate since 2020, when he first won public office. He hails from Cochabamba, the cocalero organizing stronghold where his father was a Quechua campesino leader and his mother worked for a union. After studying political science, Rodr\u00edguez [worked his way](https://www.latercera.com/mundo/noticia/andy-joven-protegido-evo-morales-aspira-convertirse-sucesor/867443/) up the ranks of Bolivia\u2019s biggest coca growers\u2019 association, eventually replacing Evo Morales as its president in 2019. In this organization, he was Morales\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and close confidant, remaining as the federation\u2019s leader during his presidency (2006-19). He [agreed](https://www.diario-red.com/articulo/america-latina/alianza-popular-bolivia-confirma-andronico-rodriguez-como-candidato-presidencial/20250519120000047676.html) to run for president with the leftist Alianza Popular coalition in May.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT WIN**\n\nGrassroots movements that support the MAS could largely back Rodr\u00edguez. Other MAS-affiliated candidates are [polling](https://elpais.bo/nacional/20250601_samuel-y-tuto-lideran-la-primera-encuesta-nacional-de-candidatos-inscritos-a-las-elecciones-2025.html?__cf_chl_tk=P4RQpjj6ZfCEY0m5pGWh56NaqEfQDK3T07yVZFR1WQU-1752007354-1.0.1.1-qbLlGO8xZIjGLR0iSGJazOCf85LEntT1lo4m0Vfs9Gg#google_vignette) in the single digits, and Rodr\u00edguez may be able to attract MAS supporters while also appealing to other voters as a fresh face less associated with the establishment. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s closer alignment with the Morales wing of the MAS over Arce\u2019s also distances him somewhat from the unpopular incumbent. For now, Morales continues to [criticize](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/evo-arremete-contra-andronico-y-lo-acusa-de-representar-intereses-de-la-derecha-2025713125143) Rodr\u00edguez and withhold his support, as Rodr\u00edguez insists that he should be allowed to run for president.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT LOSE**\n\nDue to his association with the MAS, Rodr\u00edguez may fall victim to the general anti-incumbent mood amid the country\u2019s economic decline under Arce\u2019s government. Some Morales supporters may refuse to vote for him, and other MAS voters may align with other candidates. Recent [protests](https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-evo-morales-protestas-elecciones-candidatura-inhabilitacion-a1e0e3fa8eaeac5c303e6e950d3ef5ea) in support of Morales\u2019 attempt to run for president have in some cases turned violent. Rodr\u00edguez lacks executive experience in government and has thus far appeared only [sparingly](https://www.vision360.bo/noticias/2025/07/15/28445-andronico-elude-nuevamente-un-foro-electoral-con-el-mismo-argumento-razones-de-agenda) in the media and candidate [forums](https://www.vision360.bo/noticias/2025/07/15/28445-andronico-elude-nuevamente-un-foro-electoral-con-el-mismo-argumento-razones-de-agenda).\n\n#### **WHO SUPPORTS HIM**\n\nRodr\u00edguez has support from the major campesino organizing fronts he has interacted with throughout his career. He is likely to draw votes from rural Bolivians who are often undercounted in the polls. As the youngest candidate, he may also appeal to voters who seek an alternative to established political figures.\n\n#### **WHAT HE WOULD DO**\n\nRodr\u00edguez has said he would gradually [reduce](https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/pais/andronico-habla-responde-evo-combustibles-plan-gobierno-entrevista/20250707005356975909.html) fuel and other subsidies, in line with his Alianza Popular party\u2019s \u201c[intelligent austerity](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-POPULAR.pdf)\u201d proposals, and try to reduce government spending by prioritizing the most disadvantaged sectors while cutting down on bureaucracy, redundancy, and waste. To inject dollars into the economy, he [has said](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/como-traera-andronico-rodriguez-dolares-para-bolivia-conoce-su-propuesta-economica-20257219945) he favors seeking loans from groups like BRICS over traditional lenders like the IMF. He also aims to boost exports by offering incentives to the private sector, but would also maintain strong government involvement in key areas like mining and tourism, as well as [push](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-POPULAR.pdf) import substitution through tariffs on certain sectors.\n\n#### IDEOLOGY\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IdeologyBOLIVIA_070925-scaled.jpg)\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cand_Bolivia_Quiroga.jpg)\n\nJorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga\n--------------------\n\n### 65, former president\n\n#### Alianza Libre\n\n##### \u201cThe first thing I will do when I get to the Palace of Government is return stability to the country.\u201d\n\n#### **HOW HE GOT HERE**\n\n[\u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga](https://clubmadrid.org/who/members/quiroga-jorge-fernando/) served as president from 2001-2, and has run for president three times before, most recently in 2020, [dropping out](https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/pais/20201011/semana-elecciones-tuto-quiroga-declina-su-candidatura-presidencia) before the election amid poor polling. He was finance minister under Zamora for eight months in 1992, and five years later, he became the country\u2019s youngest-ever vice president in the administration of President [Hugo B\u00e1nzer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugo-Banzer-Suarez). B\u00e1nzer was a controversial figure who had been a [right-wing military dictator](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugo-Banzer-Suarez) from 1971, when he led a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, until he was deposed in 1978. In 2001, B\u00e1nzer resigned due to ill health, and Quiroga completed B\u00e1nzer\u2019s term but opted not to run for reelection. He has worked for major Bolivian mining and banking firms as well as the IMF and the World Bank. He is running with the Libre coalition after [leaving](https://eldeber.com.bo/pais/tras-ruptura-del-bloque-de-unidad-tuto-afirma-que-esta-condenado-entenderse-con-samuel_510027/) a broader opposition group that largely opted to support Doria Medina.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT WIN**\n\nQuiroga is the main standard-bearer for Bolivia\u2019s right wing in this election, and he has long warned that the MAS\u2019 economic populism would lead to the kind of fiscal and economic crunch that has come to pass. He may be able to capitalize on widespread discontent with how Arce and the MAS have handled the economy by offering the sharpest contrast to the ruling party among all leading candidates.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT LOSE**\n\nQuiroga didn\u2019t gain traction when he ran for president in 2020 and may struggle to attract moderates, limiting his appeal beyond his conservative base. His close association with B\u00e1nzer and the unpopular record of B\u00e1nzer\u2019s presidency could alienate some voters.\n\n#### **WHO SUPPORTS HIM**\n\nAs a long-standing and vocal critic of the MAS, Quiroga is popular among the country\u2019s most conservative voters and many of those disillusioned by the Arce government. He appeals to voters who roundly reject the MAS and its economic project, and who seek a return to pre-2005 Bolivia. Quiroga has strong support among the upper classes, especially in La Paz, and major players in the private sector.\n\n#### **WHAT HE WOULD DO**\n\nQuiroga would aim to dramatically shrink the government\u2019s role in the economy and its spending. He [advocates](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-LIBERTAD-Y-DEMOCRACIA.pdf) an IMF rescue package and favors stricter austerity measures than other candidates. Quiroga has also spoken of digitalizing government to make it more efficient and transparent, and said he would give every adult in the country a [\u201cpopular property title\u201d](https://elperiodico.com.bo/tuto-quiroga-intensifica-campana-con-su-oferta-de-titulo-de-propiedad-popular-por-us-1-500/) worth $1,500, as a symbolic share of the country\u2019s natural resources that can be used to access loans.\n\n#### IDEOLOGY\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IdeologyBOLIVIA_0709253-scaled.jpg)\n\n#### ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RB-Headshot-e1704321264443.jpg)\n\n##### Rich Brown\n\nReading Time:   < 1 minute*Brown is an editor and production manager at Americas Quarterly.*\n\n**Follow Rich Brown:**\u00a0\u00a0 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-brown-62b3a118a/)\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/@richmattbrown)\n\n[![Demonstrators during a drivers' union protest against fuel shortages in La Paz in June.June 4, 2025.
