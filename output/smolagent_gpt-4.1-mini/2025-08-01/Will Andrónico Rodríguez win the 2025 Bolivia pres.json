On the right: Former President of Bolivia Evo Morales. Collage made by CONNECTAS. Used with permission.\n\n*This article, by the Bolivian journalist [Ernesto Estremadoiro](https://www.connectas.org/member/ernestoestremadoiro/), first appeared in [CONNECTAS](https://www.connectas.org/analisis/andronico-rodriguez-el-nuevo-evo-morales/). An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement.*\n\nIn 1958, Italian writer Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa offered a political paradox in his novel [\u201cThe Leopard\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leopard) that helps explain how those in power manage to stay there: \u201cIf we want things to stay as they are, everything must change.\u201d Understanding this principle helps make sense of the emergence of [Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%B3nico_Rodr%C3%ADguez) in Bolivian politics, and how his rise signals the decline of Evo Morales \u2013\u00a0but perhaps without any real change.\n\nFor nearly 20 years \u2013\u00a0except between 2019 and 2020 \u2013 Bolivia has been governed by the [Movement for Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimiento_al_Socialismo) (MAS). Between 2006 and 2014, under then president Morales, the country experienced an economic boom \u2013 but like any cycle, [the boom ended](https://www.bloomberglinea.com/latinoamerica/bolivia/el-auge-de-bolivia-esta-fracasando-e-impulsa-una-improbable-candidatura-de-evo-morales/). Since 2015, Bolivia has faced a gradual economic decline, worsened by the pandemic which happened during [Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanine_%C3%81%C3%B1ez)\u2019s interim government and continued under current president [Luis Arce Catacora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Arces_Arce), also from MAS.\n\nThis year's [general elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Bolivian_general_election), scheduled for August 17, come at a time of economic crisis and political fragmentation. MAS, once a dominant force, is now internally divided: President Arce has withdrawn his candidacy, and Morales has been disqualified by the Constitutional Court, prompting him to form a new party, [Evo Pueblo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVO_Pueblo).\n\nWith Bolivia\u2019s dollar reserves [nearly depleted](https://larazon.bo/economia-y-empresa/2025/01/08/reservas-internacionales-bolivia-2024/), rising inflation, and a ruling party split into two factions, Rodr\u00edguez has emerged as a third MAS-aligned option. On May 3, he officially announced his candidacy for president. His campaign aims to distance itself from both the economic failures attributed to Arce and the tarnished figure of Morales, who faces [allegations](https://elpais.com/america/2024-10-20/caso-evo-morales-cuando-la-violencia-sexual-contra-las-mujeres-queda-atrapada-en-el-lodo-politico.html) of sexual abuse involving minors.\n\nFor months, Rodr\u00edguez stayed out of both camps, building his own political base with support from former Morales allies. As Arce\u2019s popularity wanes, more figures have defected to Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s camp. The new contender has proposed changes to the [economic model](https://gerens.pe/blog/el-modelo-economico-boliviano-y-el-estatismo-en-la-gestion-de-la-industria-del-gas-natural-un-deja-vu-latinoamericano-de-la-crisis-economica-de-la-decada-de-1980/), which he calls a failure, though critics say his ideas are more cosmetic than structural.\n\n### Who is this millennial?\n\nBorn in [Sacaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacaba) (Cochabamba) in 1988, Rodr\u00edguez comes from a unionist family. His father, Carlos Rodr\u00edguez, was a leader in the [Cochabamba federation of farmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federaci%C3%B3n_Sindical_%C3%9Anica_de_Trabajadores_Campesinos_de_Cochabamba); his mother, Sinforosa Ledezma, bequeathed him land so he could join the [Mamor\u00e9 Bulo Bulo union](https://www.vision360.bo/noticias/2025/06/01/25926-andronico-rodriguez-es-destituido-del-cargo-de-ejecutivo-de-la-federacion-mamore-bulo-bulo)\u00a0at a young age.\n\nAt six years old, he accompanied his father to long meetings in the coca-growing region, where he learned patience and how to listen. At fifteen, he saw Morales for the first time and, by his own account, made Morales his mentor. By 22, with a political science degree from [San Sim\u00f3n University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_University_of_San_Sim\u00f3n) (UMSS), he was already a youth leader in agrarian and coca-growing groups, such as [Seis Federaciones del Tr\u00f3pico](https://www.vision360.bo/noticias/2025/05/20/25264-seis-federaciones-del-tropico-de-la-lucha-por-la-tierra-a-la-dictadura-sindical-y-el-epicentro-del-poder-con-evo). At 32, newly elected to the National Assembly, he became Senate President. Now at 37, he\u2019s aiming for the presidency. He has even had songs written in his honor, calling him \u201cson of the people\u201d and \u201ca symbol of unity.\u201d\n\nFreddy Calizaya's song \u201cHijo del Pueblo Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez\u201d (\u201cSon of the People, Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez\u201d), can be heard in the video below, as a soundtrack to footage of Rodr\u00edguez campaigning:\n\nAs MAS\u2019s internal divisions grew, Rodr\u00edguez stayed aligned with the \u201cEvistas\u201d (those who are pro-Evo Morales) and, as Senate President, became a vocal critic of Arce\u2019s administration, leading legislators to refuse to approve various loans.\n\nHowever, in recent months, he\u2019s also begun to [distance himself](https://www.dw.com/es/un-aliado-rompe-con-evo-morales-y-lanza-su-candidatura/a-72428242) from Morales, questioning aspects of the so-called \u201c[Proceso de Cambio](https://repository.globethics.net/bitstream/handle/20.500.12424/154483/CyE10-10.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)\u201d (\u201cProcess of Change\u201d) and the actions of the ruling party.\n\nInitiated by Morales and the MAS party, this process refers to the significant political, social, and economic transformations implemented since 2006 and formalized by the 2009 constitution, which aims to reshape the Bolivian state by prioritizing Indigenous rights, increasing political participation, and strengthening the role of the state in development. However, at an economic forum in Santa Cruz, Rodr\u00edguez defended the need to reform the economic model to include more private sector and cooperative participation.\n\nWhen Arce withdrew from the race, Rodr\u00edguez [wrote on social media](https://x.com/AndronicoRod/status/1922609967355367640?t=QnaxPhCkxKa2K2fyU5VkuA&amp;s=19):\n\n> A radical change is needed. Sadly, overreach, abuse of power, corruption, imprisoned farmers, constant accusations and attacks, the fragmentation of social movements, and protests both for and against the government have eroded trust in institutions, dragging us into a deep economic crisis.\n\nDespite his declarations, Rodr\u00edguez has yet to win over everyone. In an interview, political scientist Orlando Peralta referred to him as \u201ca continuation\u201d:\n\n> There\u2019s no transformation \u2013 ideologically or programmatically. He hasn\u2019t presented clear proposals. He hasn\u2019t mentioned structural reforms or specific measures to get us out of the current crisis.\n\nBy now, Peralta argues, Rodr\u00edguez should have taken a stance on key issues like a new constitution, labor reforms, incentives for production, or fiscal policy. Instead, his campaign relies more on the failures of his rivals than on his own vision.\n\nBolivia's [economic situation](https://elpais.com/america/2025-05-11/la-crisis-economica-se-erige-en-el-gran-arbitro-de-las-elecciones-en-bolivia.html) does not leave room for ambuiguous decisions. Bolivia faces depleted international reserves, unsustainable subsidies, and stagnant domestic production. Rodr\u00edguez has said nothing about how he would handle fiscal constraints or engage with the IMF or global markets. \u201cThe rightwing has a clear position: renegotiate with the IMF and cut spending. With Andr\u00f3nico, we know nothing. He remains silent,\u201d says Peralta.\n\n### Inheriting the machine without challenging it\n\nPeralta is especially critical of Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s circle: former MAS operatives, long-time Evistas, and radical leftist theorists who promote him internationally as a \u201crenewal.\u201d He suggests that this may be a renewal for the left, but not for Bolivia:\n\n> It\u2019ll be the same state model, with the same internal and external interests, and a younger rhetoric \u2013 but no real change. It\u2019s the continuation of a worn-out system, not a refoundation.\n\nRodr\u00edguez\u2019s age is his main political asset. Being under 40 lets him tap into social fatigue with strongmen like Morales. But youth alone isn\u2019t enough for a transformative project. \u201cIt\u2019s not a political virtue \u2013 it\u2019s a generational fact,\u201d says Peralta. \u201cSomeone had to fill the gap left by Evo and Arce.\u201d Despite being touted by media and international groups as a symbol of renewal, Rodr\u00edguez has yet to answer the fundamental question: does he have a real plan for Bolivia?\n\nPeralta believes Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s candidacy may simply be another attempt to keep afloat the same sinking ship. Without clear economic proposals, a reformist agenda, or independence from the old MAS apparatus, Rodr\u00edguez risks becoming the young face of an exhausted political project.\n\n### Will Morales retire?\n\nPolitical analyst Paul Coca asserts that Evo Morales effectively retired on February 21, 2016, when voters rejected his reelection bid in a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Bolivian_constitutional_referendum). \u201cEvo didn\u2019t want to accept retirement,\u201d Coca recalls. \u201cHis refusal to leave power led to the [2019 crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bolivian_political_crisis).\u201d\n\nStill, Morales continues to cast a shadow over Bolivian politics and could maintain a parliamentary presence in the next legislature. But with a fragmented opposition and a ruling party split into Evistas, Arcistas, and Androniquistas, the next parliament may be a real \u201csalad,\u201d as one analyst put it in an interview.\u00a0Governing will require coalitions, negotiation, and \u2013 above all \u2013\u00a0clear proposals.\n\nIn that scenario, Coca suggests that Rodr\u00edguez will need to go beyond symbolic rhetoric. \u201cYouth and being a new face are not enough,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed is a clear vision for the country and the ability to act.\u201d\n\n### Categories\n\nRegions\n\n*

But one thing is clear: They will mark the end of the [Movimiento al Socialismo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimiento_al_Socialismo) (MAS) party\u2019s overwhelming dominance and its program of economic populism.\n\nThe MAS and its grassroots bases are still collectively a powerful leftist political force, but polling indicates that the era of its legislative majorities and broad popular appeal is over, and it is no longer the party most likely to secure the presidency. Fractures within the MAS are growing, and opposition figures are gaining momentum. This is creating opportunities for centrists, the right, and a new leftist faction led by Senate President Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, who was a MAS leader before the party splintered.\n\nAll this means that the elections are virtually certain to usher in a new political landscape in which power is more diffuse, any legislative majority will be conditional, and broader coalitions will be required to govern.\n\nRegardless of who wins, coalition-building will be just one of many major challenges to governability. President Luis Arce, [elected](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-evo-morales-elections-socialism-bolivia-f8d2fb4ac80db6f7fd8face7c3f7b75d) in 2020 on the MAS ticket, has led the country into its worst [financial and economic crisis](https://americasquarterly.org/article/escape-economic-crisis-bolivia/) since the hyperinflation of 1985, and the country will likely take years to recover. Until then, prolonged instability appears almost inevitable.\n\n**Dire straits**\n\nDuring the boom of gas exports to Brazil and Argentina that occurred during Evo Morales\u2019 presidency, the MAS enjoyed broad popularity for its programs of economic distribution to regional and municipal governments. These programs helped to reduce poverty, especially in the most marginalized areas of the country, albeit in some cases just temporarily. This period of government largesse based on abundant natural resource revenue, however, has come to an end.\n\nGas revenue has plummeted due to economic mismanagement and a lack of investment, and the country\u2019s foreign currency reserves have declined from [over $15 billion](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/BOLIVIA-ECONOMY/myvmoarkjvr/) in 2014 to under $2 billion today. Most of that is gold, with as little as [$47 million](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-bolivia-to-ccc-24-01-2025) left in hard currency, according to Fitch Ratings, which downgraded Bolivia to CCC- status in January. The CCC- [rating](https://www.fitchratings.com/products/rating-definitions) indicates a very high level of credit risk, suggesting a significant possibility of default on national debt obligations.\n\nFor ordinary people, prices are rising sharply; the IMF [projects](https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/BOL) 15.1% inflation for 2025. Gas shortages regularly force drivers to wait many hours at the pump, and the government is still enforcing an exchange rate of 6.96 bolivianos to the U.S. dollar, while the black-market exchange rate hovers [around 14](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/a-cuanto-se-cotiza-el-dolar-paralelo-en-bolivia-este-domingo-20-de-julio-vuelve-a-bajar-202572073947).\n\nMorales\u2019 personal fortunes have fallen just as hard. President from 2005-2019, he is now a fugitive from justice, [accused](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/evo-morales-arrest-sex-abuse) of fathering a child with a 15-year-old girl in 2015 and [related charges](https://buenosairesherald.com/world/latin-america/understanding-the-statutory-rape-accusations-against-bolivias-evo-morales), including statutory rape. He denies wrongdoing and has said the charges are politically motivated. And even though Morales insists he should be able to campaign for president this year, the constitutional court ruled [unanimously](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bolivia-top-court-upholds-ruling-blocking-morales-election-eligibility-2025-05-14/) in May that no person can run for a third presidential term, effectively barring him from the race.\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AQChart_Glance_Bolivia072325-953x1024.jpg)\n\n**Presidential contenders**\n\nThe MAS now has three main factions jockeying for power. Arce, who has opted not to run for [reelection](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bolivia-president-arce-says-he-will-not-run-re-election-2025-05-14/) due to his dismal approval ratings, is backing his former Interior Minister, Eduardo del Castillo. However, polling [indicates](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/atencion-bolivia-estos-son-los-resultados-de-intencion-de-voto-de-la-segunda-encuesta-nacional-202562918130) that he has failed to gain traction. MAS maverick [Eva Copa](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/a-young-mayor-rides-bolivias-political-shake-up/), the 38-year-old mayor of El Alto who has often bucked the party, leads a second faction of Arce dissenters, but she is similarly [lagging](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/atencion-bolivia-estos-son-los-resultados-de-intencion-de-voto-de-la-segunda-encuesta-nacional-202562918130) in the polls.\n\nThe MAS candidate with the best prospects is Senate President Rodr\u00edguez, the 36-year-old former right-hand man to Evo Morales. He is trying to brand himself as a new kind of MAS leader who can reconcile with the opposition, crack down on corruption and abuse of power, and undo the economic mismanagement of the past decade. Andr\u00f3nico, as he is popularly known, has been unwilling to take firm stances on the MAS\u2019s internal disputes, and chose Morales\u2019 former Planning Minister Mariana Padro, a middle-class professional, as his running mate. Still, Morales has thus far withheld public support for Andr\u00f3nico.\n\nThe divisions within the MAS give the opposition its best chance since 2005 to win a national election. However, the opposition is itself also very fractured. Its three leading candidates\u2014business magnate Samuel Doria Medina, former President Jorge (Tuto) Quiroga, and Cochabamba Mayor Manfred Reyes Villa\u2014have all spent decades in politics and are unlikely to drop out.\n\nAll this indicates that the presidential election will likely result in a competitive head-to-head runoff on October 19 between Andr\u00f3nico\u2014who is likely to win support from rural voters less likely to be captured in polling\u2014and one of the opposition candidates.\n\n**Instability ahead**\n\nThe legislative result will be much more mixed. While hard to predict, the MAS majorities in the upper and lower chambers are likely to shrink considerably. If they survive, they will be narrow. If they do not, the opposition may be able to coalesce into a governing coalition, although this is also uncertain.\n\nWhat is certain is that there will be no quick fix to the dire [economic situation](https://americasquarterly.org/article/escape-economic-crisis-bolivia/). If new natural gas and lithium exports are to materialize, this will take time. If meaningful efforts to cut government spending are undertaken, they will be met with intense protests.\n\nA two-decade political cycle is drawing to a close. It is giving way to the next, which seems sure to begin with several years of protracted instability.\n\n#### ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pedraza-Headshot.jpg)\n\n##### Gustavo Pedraza\n\nReading Time:   4 minutes\n\n*Pedraza is a Bolivian political analyst and a former minister of sustainable development.

In the race for president, if no candidate secures more than 50% of the vote or a 10-percentage-point advantage over the rest of the field, the two leading contenders will head to a runoff scheduled for October 19. The presidential and legislative winners will all take office on November 8.\n\nThe country\u2019s deep [economic crisis](https://americasquarterly.org/article/escape-economic-crisis-bolivia/) is top-of-mind for voters as inflation, fuel shortages, and a lack of formal employment opportunities continue to weigh on the public. President Luis Arce has [opted](https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-elections-morales-arce-race-campaign-polls-leftwing-9296923408ddcfa429aff4cf9e3e7626) not to run for reelection, and a Constitutional Court ruling in May [barred](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bolivia-top-court-upholds-ruling-blocking-morales-election-eligibility-2025-05-14/) former President Evo Morales from participating.\n\nThe candidates polling over 10% in a July [Ipsos Ciesmori](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/07/14/mas-incertidumbre-electoral-en-bolivia-por-nueva-encuesta-en-la-que-sube-el-voto-blanco-nulo-e-indeciso/) survey are included below in alphabetical order by last name. *AQ*\u202fasked a dozen nonpartisan experts on Bolivia to help us identify where each candidate stands on two spectrums: left versus right on economic matters, and personalistic versus institutionalist on leadership style. We\u2019ve published the averages of their responses, with a caveat: Platforms evolve, and so do candidates. We will occasionally update this page to reflect developments in the campaigns.\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cand_Bolivia_Medina.jpg)\n\nSamuel Doria Medina\n-------------------\n\n### 66, business magnate and former minister of planning\n\n#### Alianza Unidad\n\n##### \u201cWe have the best team and a serious plan to stabilize the economy in 100 days.\u201d\n\n#### **HOW HE GOT HERE**\n\nDoria is one of the country\u2019s wealthiest businessmen and is running for president for the fourth time. He led Soboce, the country\u2019s biggest cement manufacturer, from 1987 until he [sold](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/12/16/691838/34261/en/Samuel-Doria-Medina-Sells-Soboce-to-Completely-Devote-Himself-to-the-Bolivian-People.html) his controlling stake for around [$300 million](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/06/29/samuel-doria-medina-candidato-a-presidente-de-bolivia-en-los-ultimos-20-anos-el-gobierno-ha-cohabitado-con-el-narcotrafico/) in 2014 to mount a presidential bid. He has led other large [companies](https://www.noticiasfides.com/nacional/politica/doria-medina-a-garcia-linera-no-conozco-a-gustavo-vedia-y-no-soy-dueno-de-subway--365669-365580) and built Bolivia\u2019s [tallest skyscraper](https://greentower.com.bo/la-paz). A longtime centrist and social democrat, he was minister of planning (1991-93) in the administration of President Jaime Paz Zamora. In the 2020 election, he was incumbent President Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s [running mate](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2020/02/02/jeanine-anez-eligio-a-samuel-doria-medina-como-companero-de-formula-para-las-elecciones-en-bolivia/) before they [dropped out](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-54200128) of the race amid poor polling. He is now at the head of the largest opposition [coalition](https://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/samuel-doria-medina-inscribe-alianza-234750859.html), Unidad, which includes prominent groups like Creemos, backed by Luis Fernando Camacho, and Comunidad Ciudadana, led by former President Carlos Mesa.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT WIN**\n\nGiven President Arce\u2019s [lack of popular support](https://x.com/cidgallup/status/1889078200346583506/photo/1), the [rifts within the ruling MAS party](https://americasquarterly.org/article/bolivia-enters-contentious-new-political-landscape/), and the country\u2019s [economic straits](https://americasquarterly.org/article/escape-economic-crisis-bolivia/), many voters appear ready to support a moderate opposition candidate. As a centrist, Doria Medina may attract former MAS supporters who are looking for an alternative outside of the conservative right. His [background in business](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/06/29/samuel-doria-medina-candidato-a-presidente-de-bolivia-en-los-ultimos-20-anos-el-gobierno-ha-cohabitado-con-el-narcotrafico/) allows him to maintain that he is a political outsider, and his track record of entrepreneurial success lends credibility to his claims that he can fix the economy. He has shown with Unidad that he can lead a coalition, and recently won the backing of [Marcelo Claure](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-18/bolivia-s-richest-man-backs-a-millionaire-candidate-in-bid-to-oust-the-left?sref=5LmjrEiv), Bolivia\u2019s richest man.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT LOSE**\n\nSome voters might prefer other moderate candidates with more government experience. Doria Medina\u2019s reputation as a perennial presidential candidate may be detrimental to his outsider image. He could also be overtaken by candidates further to the right, who have adopted a less conciliatory and more aggressive stance toward the MAS and the status quo.\n\n#### **WHO SUPPORTS HIM**\n\nHe has broad name recognition and appears to be drawing support from both longtime moderate MAS opponents and voters who have more recently soured on the ruling party. His supporters tend to believe that he is the opposition candidate most likely to unite enough of the country behind him to win. Doria Medina\u2019s strongest support comes from the middle classes, with the poorest individuals tending to lean toward leftist candidates and the richest tending to lean further to the right. As the candidate of the broadest opposition coalition, he has won endorsements from [public intellectuals](https://eldeber.com.bo/pais/vicente-cuellar-renuncia-su-candidatura-y-mantiene-su-apoyo-samuel_514268/) and business leaders alike.\n\n#### **WHAT HE WOULD DO**\n\nLike all leading candidates, he plans to [reduce](https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2025/06/29/samuel-doria-medina-candidato-a-presidente-de-bolivia-en-los-ultimos-20-anos-el-gobierno-ha-cohabitado-con-el-narcotrafico/) fuel and other subsidies to cut government spending. Doria Medina emphasizes [transparency](https://www.noticiasfides.com/nacional/politica/doria-medina-ve-prioritario-que-el-gobierno-trabaje-en-recuperar-la-credibilidad-del-censo-418614), incentives for small businesses, and reductions in taxes and red tape for the private sector.

He hails from Cochabamba, the cocalero organizing stronghold where his father was a Quechua campesino leader and his mother worked for a union. After studying political science, Rodr\u00edguez [worked his way](https://www.latercera.com/mundo/noticia/andy-joven-protegido-evo-morales-aspira-convertirse-sucesor/867443/) up the ranks of Bolivia\u2019s biggest coca growers\u2019 association, eventually replacing Evo Morales as its president in 2019. In this organization, he was Morales\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and close confidant, remaining as the federation\u2019s leader during his presidency (2006-19). He [agreed](https://www.diario-red.com/articulo/america-latina/alianza-popular-bolivia-confirma-andronico-rodriguez-como-candidato-presidencial/20250519120000047676.html) to run for president with the leftist Alianza Popular coalition in May.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT WIN**\n\nGrassroots movements that support the MAS could largely back Rodr\u00edguez. Other MAS-affiliated candidates are [polling](https://elpais.bo/nacional/20250601_samuel-y-tuto-lideran-la-primera-encuesta-nacional-de-candidatos-inscritos-a-las-elecciones-2025.html?__cf_chl_tk=P4RQpjj6ZfCEY0m5pGWh56NaqEfQDK3T07yVZFR1WQU-1752007354-1.0.1.1-qbLlGO8xZIjGLR0iSGJazOCf85LEntT1lo4m0Vfs9Gg#google_vignette) in the single digits, and Rodr\u00edguez may be able to attract MAS supporters while also appealing to other voters as a fresh face less associated with the establishment. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s closer alignment with the Morales wing of the MAS over Arce\u2019s also distances him somewhat from the unpopular incumbent. For now, Morales continues to [criticize](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/evo-arremete-contra-andronico-y-lo-acusa-de-representar-intereses-de-la-derecha-2025713125143) Rodr\u00edguez and withhold his support, as Rodr\u00edguez insists that he should be allowed to run for president.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT LOSE**\n\nDue to his association with the MAS, Rodr\u00edguez may fall victim to the general anti-incumbent mood amid the country\u2019s economic decline under Arce\u2019s government. Some Morales supporters may refuse to vote for him, and other MAS voters may align with other candidates. Recent [protests](https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-evo-morales-protestas-elecciones-candidatura-inhabilitacion-a1e0e3fa8eaeac5c303e6e950d3ef5ea) in support of Morales\u2019 attempt to run for president have in some cases turned violent. Rodr\u00edguez lacks executive experience in government and has thus far appeared only [sparingly](https://www.vision360.bo/noticias/2025/07/15/28445-andronico-elude-nuevamente-un-foro-electoral-con-el-mismo-argumento-razones-de-agenda) in the media and candidate [forums](https://www.vision360.bo/noticias/2025/07/15/28445-andronico-elude-nuevamente-un-foro-electoral-con-el-mismo-argumento-razones-de-agenda).\n\n#### **WHO SUPPORTS HIM**\n\nRodr\u00edguez has support from the major campesino organizing fronts he has interacted with throughout his career. He is likely to draw votes from rural Bolivians who are often undercounted in the polls. As the youngest candidate, he may also appeal to voters who seek an alternative to established political figures.\n\n#### **WHAT HE WOULD DO**\n\nRodr\u00edguez has said he would gradually [reduce](https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/pais/andronico-habla-responde-evo-combustibles-plan-gobierno-entrevista/20250707005356975909.html) fuel and other subsidies, in line with his Alianza Popular party\u2019s \u201c[intelligent austerity](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-POPULAR.pdf)\u201d proposals, and try to reduce government spending by prioritizing the most disadvantaged sectors while cutting down on bureaucracy, redundancy, and waste. To inject dollars into the economy, he [has said](https://www.reduno.com.bo/noticias/como-traera-andronico-rodriguez-dolares-para-bolivia-conoce-su-propuesta-economica-20257219945) he favors seeking loans from groups like BRICS over traditional lenders like the IMF. He also aims to boost exports by offering incentives to the private sector, but would also maintain strong government involvement in key areas like mining and tourism, as well as [push](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-POPULAR.pdf) import substitution through tariffs on certain sectors.\n\n#### IDEOLOGY\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IdeologyBOLIVIA_070925-scaled.jpg)\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cand_Bolivia_Quiroga.jpg)\n\nJorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga\n--------------------\n\n### 65, former president\n\n#### Alianza Libre\n\n##### \u201cThe first thing I will do when I get to the Palace of Government is return stability to the country.\u201d\n\n#### **HOW HE GOT HERE**\n\n[\u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga](https://clubmadrid.org/who/members/quiroga-jorge-fernando/) served as president from 2001-2, and has run for president three times before, most recently in 2020, [dropping out](https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/pais/20201011/semana-elecciones-tuto-quiroga-declina-su-candidatura-presidencia) before the election amid poor polling. He was finance minister under Zamora for eight months in 1992, and five years later, he became the country\u2019s youngest-ever vice president in the administration of President [Hugo B\u00e1nzer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugo-Banzer-Suarez). B\u00e1nzer was a controversial figure who had been a [right-wing military dictator](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugo-Banzer-Suarez) from 1971, when he led a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, until he was deposed in 1978. In 2001, B\u00e1nzer resigned due to ill health, and Quiroga completed B\u00e1nzer\u2019s term but opted not to run for reelection. He has worked for major Bolivian mining and banking firms as well as the IMF and the World Bank. He is running with the Libre coalition after [leaving](https://eldeber.com.bo/pais/tras-ruptura-del-bloque-de-unidad-tuto-afirma-que-esta-condenado-entenderse-con-samuel_510027/) a broader opposition group that largely opted to support Doria Medina.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT WIN**\n\nQuiroga is the main standard-bearer for Bolivia\u2019s right wing in this election, and he has long warned that the MAS\u2019 economic populism would lead to the kind of fiscal and economic crunch that has come to pass. He may be able to capitalize on widespread discontent with how Arce and the MAS have handled the economy by offering the sharpest contrast to the ruling party among all leading candidates.\n\n#### **WHY HE MIGHT LOSE**\n\nQuiroga didn\u2019t gain traction when he ran for president in 2020 and may struggle to attract moderates, limiting his appeal beyond his conservative base. His close association with B\u00e1nzer and the unpopular record of B\u00e1nzer\u2019s presidency could alienate some voters.\n\n#### **WHO SUPPORTS HIM**\n\nAs a long-standing and vocal critic of the MAS, Quiroga is popular among the country\u2019s most conservative voters and many of those disillusioned by the Arce government. He appeals to voters who roundly reject the MAS and its economic project, and who seek a return to pre-2005 Bolivia. Quiroga has strong support among the upper classes, especially in La Paz, and major players in the private sector.\n\n#### **WHAT HE WOULD DO**\n\nQuiroga would aim to dramatically shrink the government\u2019s role in the economy and its spending. He [advocates](https://www.oep.org.bo/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PROGRAMA-DE-GOBIERNO-ALIANZA-LIBERTAD-Y-DEMOCRACIA.pdf) an IMF rescue package and favors stricter austerity measures than other candidates. Quiroga has also spoken of digitalizing government to make it more efficient and transparent, and said he would give every adult in the country a [\u201cpopular property title\u201d](https://elperiodico.com.bo/tuto-quiroga-intensifica-campana-con-su-oferta-de-titulo-de-propiedad-popular-por-us-1-500/) worth $1,500, as a symbolic share of the country\u2019s natural resources that can be used to access loans.\n\n#### IDEOLOGY\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IdeologyBOLIVIA_0709253-scaled.jpg)\n\n#### ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n![](https://americasquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RB-Headshot-e1704321264443.jpg)\n\n##### Rich Brown\n\nReading Time:   < 1 minute*Brown is an editor and production manager at Americas Quarterly.*\n\n**Follow Rich Brown:**\u00a0\u00a0 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-brown-62b3a118a/)\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/@richmattbrown)\n\n[![Demonstrators during a drivers' union protest against fuel shortages in La Paz in June.June 4, 2025.

A centrist social democrat, he served as planning minister during the 1990s under President Jaime Paz Zamora and has run for president three times before. In a recent interview with newspaper *El Pa\u00eds,* he proposed closing public companies and implementing austerity measures to solve the country\u2019s current economic crisis.\n\n**Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga** (65; left in cover photo) was vice president to Hugo Banzer, the former dictator who was democratically elected for a term in 1997. Quiroga served as president for one year, between August 2001 and August 2002, after Banzer stepped down due to ill health.\n\nCoca growers\u2019 leader and senate president **Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez** (36; center in cover photo) was ultimately given the go-ahead to run after legal challenges held his candidacy in limbo. He is running with **Alianza Pol\u00edtica** after splintering from the ruling leftist **Movement Towards Socialism** (MAS, by its Spanish initials) party. Formerly seen as a Morales prot\u00e9g\u00e9, his split from the MAS was a \u201cvery big assertion of independence,\u201d said Von Vacano.\n\n\u201cAndr\u00f3nico saw that both Arce and Evo had worn out their appeal. They\u2019d eroded bases, popular support, and moral authority. He\u2019s been trying to argue that he\u2019s the moral voice of the movement.\u201d\n\nRunning for MAS is **Eduardo del Castillo** (36). He served as minister of government under the Arce administration, a role that gave him extensive control over the police and armed forces. Close to the current government, he would be well-positioned to protect Arce from any legal trouble once he left office, according to Von Vacano.\n\nEl Alto Mayor **Eva Copa** (38) is running with the **National Renovation Movement (Morena)**. She surged to prominence after becoming senate president following the coup that pushed out Morales and many of his top officials in 2019. A MAS member at the time, she grew a support base from those who saw her as standing up and facing the music during Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s far-right interim presidency. However, she split with the MAS after they failed to make her their El Alto mayoral candidate. She split to form her own party and steamrollered the opposition, securing 69% of the vote. Despite this, she is seen as lacking the broader political and nationwide support base she\u2019d need to carry her to the presidency.\n\n**Manfred Reyes Villa** (70) is mayor of the city of Cochabamba, in Central Bolivia, a role he also held in the 1990s. Before going into politics, he served in the Bolivian military, and his law-and-order discourse could prove popular with right-wing voters, according to Von Vacano.\n\nA handful of smaller candidates are also in the race, but they are not currently expected to win. These include libertarian financial consultant Jaime Dunn, centrist senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira, and Santa Cruz city mayor Jhonny Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe9ISVfql7T49yTB1pVk96eX0SuDQohqxLE3b5N-vvafvPX8uSLjw6EJEiO1LIbaNvEb9LdYHFTNSSjXO0Cn286t9fk-4UD7yeaFkcl6usP2cYN0nxUUIWhMugaEYipbPRyOxEi6w?key=4ZlfOUNd0ewLJlpcOhe3_Q)\n\nThe big names that aren\u2019t on the list\n-------------------------------------\n\nLeftist former President **Evo Morales** intended to run for re-election. However, he was unable to form an eligible party after splitting with MAS. Morales faces charges of statutory rape and trafficking \u2014 accusations he is also facing in Argentina. For months, he has remained sequestered in Chapare, his base of support in the tropical region of Cochabamba department, to escape arrest.\n\nMorales initially attempted to run again with a miniscule party known as *Frente para la Victoria (Victory Front)*, but the alliance crumbled and he was unable to make alternative arrangements.\n\n***You may also be interested in:*** [***Bolivia\u2019s Evo Morales has broken with MAS. Now what?***](https://buenosairesherald.com/world/latin-america/bolivias-evo-morales-has-broken-with-mas-now-what)\n\nMoreover, Bolivia\u2019s Plurinational Constitutional Court ruled on May 13 that [nobody can serve](https://tcpbolivia.bo/2025/05/14/sentencia-historica-del-tcp-cierra-toda-posibilidad-de-eleccion-continua-o-discontinua-para-presidente-o-vicepresidente/) more than two terms as president or vice president, irrespective of whether those terms are consecutive. Morales served three consecutive terms as president between 2006 and 2019.\n\nMorales\u2019s supporters blocked roads to protest his omission from the list. At the time of writing, the security forces had cleared the blockade on the major highway between Oruro and Cochabamba. Five people \u2014 four police officers and one civilian \u2014 had been killed in the clashes.\n\nCurrent President **Luis Arce** was eligible to run for re-election, but announced in mid-May that he was [pulling out of the race](https://buenosairesherald.com/world/bolivias-arce-withdraws-from-election-asking-morales-to-drop-out). The leftist economist has presided over an economic crisis that has seen dollar reserves dwindle, parallel exchange rates pop up, and double-digit inflation take hold, and his popularity has tanked.\n\nSome prominent figures on the Bolivian far right, including \u00c1\u00f1ez and [Luis Fernando Camacho](https://buenosairesherald.com/world/latin-america/bolivian-governor-camacho-arrested-on-terror-charges-over-2019-coup), are in prison over the 2019 coup and are not running.\n\nThe economic crisis has prompted Bolivians to make comparisons with Argentina, Von Vacano said. In some quarters, he said, \u201cArgentina is being portrayed as both the model of the crisis \u2014 and of the solution.\u201d\n\nNewsletter\n==========\n\nRelated Posts\n-------------\n\n[Election

Rodr\u00edguez has a background in political science and has been deeply involved in Bolivia\u2019s cocalero movement, which advocates for coca growers' rights, as has Morales.\n\nOther leftwing candidates include former Government (Interior) Minister Eduardo del Castillo (Movimiento al Socialismo) and El Alto Mayor Eva Copa (Morena party). Running on the opposite end of the political spectrum will be Samuel Doria Medina (Unidad), Jorge Quiroga (Libre), and Manfred Reyes Villa (Autonom\u00eda Para Bolivia).\n\nBolivia's Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) confirmed Rodr\u00edguez's candidacy Friday after overcoming legal challenges that had temporarily halted his registration. Previously affiliated with the Movimiento Al Socialismo (MAS), Rodr\u00edguez jumped into the limelight in 2019 when he became a prominent voice against the interim government of Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, positioning himself as a leader within the progressive movement. In addition, his presidential bid is backed by the Movimiento Tercer Sistema (MTS), a center-left party that has gained traction in recent years, plus a coalition of social organizations, youth groups, and former MAS members, making him a strong contender in the upcoming elections.\n\nAnalysts suggest that Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s candidacy could mark a turning point in Bolivian politics, potentially signaling the end of Morales' influence and the emergence of a new generation of leaders.\n\nMorales' candidacy was turned down after the TSE annulled the Pan-Bol party\u2019s legal status for non-compliance with electoral laws, TSE Chief Justice \u00d3scar Hassenteufel confirmed. In addition, Morales, who ruled between 2006 and 2019, is constitutionally barred from further reelection and is supporting nationwide road blockades in protest.\n\nA recent poll by Ipsos CIESMORI game Doria Medina 19.1% of the voting intention, followed by Quiroga (18.4%), Rodriguez (14.2%), and Reyes Villa (7.9%).\n\n**Categories:**\n[Politics](/politics), [Latin America](/latin-america).\n\n### Top Comments\n\n[Disclaimer & comment rules](javascript:popup(commentsRules,'','fast',true,'#close-popup',460);)\n\nCommenting for this story is now closed.  \nIf you have a Facebook account, become a fan and comment on our **[Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/MercoPress-South-Atlantic-News-Agency/139220750082)**!\n\n* [Follow us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MercoPress/)\n* [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mercopressnews)\n* Get our news on your inbox!\n\n  Suscribe\n\n[![Advertisement](/data/publicidad/63/fit.jpg)](http://www.falklandislands.com)\n\n* [About MercoPress.](/about-mercopress)\n* |\n* [RSS Feeds](/feeds)\n* |\n* [Contact us](/contact)\n* |\n* [Advertise](/advertise)\n\u00a9 Copyright 1997 -
