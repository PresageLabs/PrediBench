{"question": "Israel x Hamas ceasefire by August 15?", "choice": "no", "messages": [{"task": "Let's say we are the August 01, 2025.\n                Please answer the below question by yes or no. But first, run a detailed analysis. You can search the web for information.\n                One good method for analyzing is to break down the question into sub-parts, like a tree, and assign probabilities to each sub-branch of the tree, to get a total probability of the question being true.\n                Here is the question:\n                Israel x Hamas ceasefire by August 15?\n                More details:\n                On March 17, Israel announced extensive strikes on terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip ending a previous ceasefire agreement which had been agreed on January 15 (See: https://x.com/IDF/status/1901802698237935705).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if there is an official ceasefire agreement, defined as a publicly announced and mutually agreed halt in military engagement, between Israel and Hamas between July 14, and August 15, 2025, 11:59 PM ET.\n\nIf the agreement is officially reached before the resolution date, this market will resolve to \"Yes\", regardless of whether the ceasefire officially starts afterwards.\n\nAn announced agreement to reinstate the previous agreed upon January 15th ceasefire deal will qualify.\n\nAny form of informal agreement will not be considered an official ceasefire. Humanitarian pauses will not count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market's resolution will be based on official announcements from both Israel and Hamas, however a wide consensus of credible media reporting stating an official ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas has been reached will suffice.\n\n\n                Here are the latest rates for the 'yes' to that question (rates for 'yes' and 'no' sum to 1), to guide you:\n                2025-07-18    0.670\n2025-07-19    0.675\n2025-07-20    0.665\n2025-07-21    0.635\n2025-07-22    0.570\n2025-07-23    0.645\n2025-07-24    0.595\n2025-07-25    0.340\n2025-07-26    0.255\n2025-07-27    0.230\n2025-07-28    0.295\n2025-07-29    0.265\n2025-07-30    0.175\n2025-07-31    0.195\n2025-08-01    0.195\n\n                Invest in yes only if you think the yes is underrated, and invest in no only if you think that the yes is overrated.\n                What would you decide: buy yes, buy no, or do nothing?\n", "task_images": null, "model_input_messages": "removed"}, {"step_number": 1, "timing": {"start_time": 1755157222.505585, "end_time": 1755157224.630944, "duration": 2.125359058380127}, "model_input_messages": "removed", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_CAeiDc2sxWBh3t3K2dX87HuR", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "web_search", "arguments": {"query": "Israel Hamas ceasefire August 2025"}}}], "error": null, "model_output_message": {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": {"query": "Israel Hamas ceasefire August 2025"}, "name": "web_search", "description": null}, "id": "call_CAeiDc2sxWBh3t3K2dX87HuR", "type": "function"}], "raw": {"_type": "ChatCompletion", "id": "chatcmpl-C4MrOPzOmAuMjKz0XOWlTJHreojL0", "choices": [{"_type": "Choice", "finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"_type": "ChatCompletionMessage", "content": null, "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": [{"_type": "ChatCompletionMessageToolCall", "id": "call_CAeiDc2sxWBh3t3K2dX87HuR", "function": {"_type": "Function", "arguments": {"query": "Israel Hamas ceasefire August 2025"}, "name": "web_search"}, "type": "function"}]}}], "created": 1755157222, "model": "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5", "usage": {"_type": "CompletionUsage", "completion_tokens": 21, "prompt_tokens": 1686, "total_tokens": 1707, "completion_tokens_details": {"_type": "CompletionTokensDetails", "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"_type": "PromptTokensDetails", "audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1024}}, "_request_id": "req_a748a01ff8084e57a96598a1e32e9d72"}, "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 1686, "output_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 1707}}, "model_output": null, "code_action": null, "observations": "## Search Results for 'Israel Hamas ceasefire August 2025'\n0.

It thanks the mediators, particularly the United States, Qatar and Egypt, for their efforts that made this agreement possible, and calls on the parties to implement it immediately.\n\nFor more than a year, France has been calling for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza, the unconditional release of hostages and the massive and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to the enclave, in order to end the intolerable suffering of civilians and work on a political solution.\n\nThis agreement should enable the release of all hostages still in captivity in Gaza, including two French nationals, Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi. France fought untiringly for their release, from the very first days to these last hours. We are totally committed to ensuring they can be reunited with their loved ones.\n\nToday, more than a year after the 7 October massacres committed in Israel by Hamas, which cost the lives of almost 1,200 people, including 49 French nationals, and after 15 months of war that followed and that has subjected Gaza\u2019s people to extreme suffering and destroyed almost all vital infrastructure, the ceasefire must absolutely be implemented and sustained. The absolute humanitarian emergency in Gaza must be addressed, and reconstruction work must begin immediately.\n\nFrance calls for all Gaza access points to be opened immediately and for the work of international organizations and humanitarian agencies to be facilitated by Israel, in accordance with international law and the rulings of the International Court of Justice. Life must once again prevail in Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority should administrate this Palestinian territory, and its return must be prepared.\n\nFrance calls for the friends of Israel and Palestine to seize the opportunity offered by this ceasefire to trigger an irreversible process for the effective implementation of the two-state solution, with security guarantees for both the Israelis and the Palestinians, which is the only avenue to ensure a just and lasting peace.\n\nFrance is committed to this, alongside its partners, within the United Nations Security Council and all international forums. In June 2025, it will co-chair, alongside Saudi Arabia, an international conference on the implementation of the two-state solution. France calls on the Israelis and Palestinians to take the only path that will guarantee them a future of peace and security.\n\nUseful links\n------------\n\n* **Links**\n  + [More information on the website of the ministry (in French)](fr/dossiers-pays/israel-territoires-palestiniens/ \"More information on the website of the ministry (in French)\")\n  + [Embassy of France in Israel / Palestinian territories](https://il.ambafrance.org/ \"Embassy of France in Israel / Palestinian territories\")\n  + [Embassy of Israel / Palestinian territories in France](fr/le-ministere-et-son-reseau/representations-etrangeres-en-france/ \"Embassy of Israel / Palestinian territories in France\")\n  + [Embassy of France in Israel on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ambfranceisrael/ \"Embassy of France in Israel on Facebook\")\n\n* [Israel / Palestinian Territories](en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/) \n  + [France and Israel](en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/france-and-israel/)\n  + [France and Palestinian Territories](en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/france-and-palestinian-territories/)\n  + [Peace Process](en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/peace-process/)\n  + [French humanitarian action in the Palestinian Territories](en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/french-humanitarian-action-in-the-palestinian-territories/)\n  + [News](en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/news/)\n    -
